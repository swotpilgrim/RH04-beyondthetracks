# Chapter 18: Bowing to Authority

The thing about small towns is there are no secrets. Everything that matters—and plenty that doesn't—gets passed around like currency. By Wednesday morning, half of Copper Ridge knew about the fight at the community center. By Wednesday afternoon, the other half had heard about Pastor Mitchell forbidding his daughter from going back.

I didn't witness any of Grace's conversations with her father. Didn't need to. The town's gossip network filled in the gaps whether I wanted them filled or not.

First I heard about it from Marty. We were grabbing coffee at Joe's Diner before our shift, and he slid into the booth across from me with that look on his face—the one that said he had information he wasn't sure he should share.

"So," he started, dumping sugar into his coffee. "My girl Sarah's sister works at the church. In the office."

"Okay." I focused on my own coffee, black and bitter as the past few days had been.

"She says there was a big argument at the Mitchell house Monday night. Pastor and his daughter. Heard it got pretty heated."

My hands tightened around the mug. "Not my business."

"She was arguing about you, Tommy." Marty's voice was gentle, which somehow made it worse. "Defending you. Saying you're not who her father thinks you are."

I took a long drink of scalding coffee, welcoming the burn. "What'd the pastor say?"

"That you might have good moments, but you're still from a rough background. Still got into a public fight." Marty paused. "Said the fight proved your nature."

Proved your nature. Like I was a dog that couldn't help biting, no matter how well-trained. I set down my mug carefully, afraid I might shatter it otherwise.

"He's not wrong."

"Tommy—"

"He's not." I met Marty's eyes. "You saw me fight Eddie. Everyone saw. Pastor Mitchell's doing what any father would do—protecting his daughter from a guy who solves problems with his fists."

Marty looked like he wanted to argue, but we both knew the truth when we heard it. He changed the subject to the Indians' pitching rotation, and I let him.

But the gossip didn't stop there.

At the rail yard during lunch break, I overheard two guys from the morning shift talking. They didn't know I was close enough to hear, sitting in my truck with the window down.

"—church ladies are all worked up about it," one of them said. "Margaret Walsh told everyone at Wednesday service that the Mitchell girl's been spending too much time on the wrong side of the tracks."

"Pastor's daughter slumming it?" The other man laughed. "Bet that went over well."

"Walsh says the girl argued with her father something fierce. Told him he was being prejudiced, that judging folks by their neighborhood wasn't Christian."

"She's got a point."

"Maybe. But Mitchell's got a point too. You let your daughter hang around rough neighborhoods, rough things happen. Like that fight. Walsh says church committee saw the whole thing—Keane kid and that Russo boy beating each other bloody in front of children."

"Keane's the one helps out at the center, right? Thought he was supposed to be one of the good ones."

"Good ones from bad neighborhoods are still from bad neighborhoods." The first man's voice was matter-of-fact, like he was discussing the weather. "Can't blame Mitchell for pulling his daughter out."

I started my truck before I could hear more. Drove to the far end of the yard and ate my sandwich alone, tasting nothing.

Thursday morning, my mother came home from the market with news she delivered carefully while I was fixing the porch railing.

"Saw Sarah Mitchell at the grocer's," she said, too casual. "We were in line together."

I kept working, hammer striking nail with steady rhythm. "Yeah?"

"She asked about you. About your face." Ma touched my shoulder gently. "I told her you were healing fine."

"That all?"

"She said..." Ma paused, choosing words. "She said Grace has been very upset this week. That there's been tension in their home. She didn't say it outright, but I gathered it's about you and the center."

I drove the nail home harder than necessary. "Nothing to do with me anymore."

"Sarah seemed sad about it. Like she wished things were different but didn't know how to make them different." Ma squeezed my shoulder. "She's a kind woman. Caught between her husband and her daughter, I imagine."

"Pastor Mitchell's doing what he thinks is right."

"Doesn't make it easier for anyone involved." Ma went inside, leaving me with the hammer and too many thoughts.

Friday evening, washing up before dinner, I heard my father and mother talking in the kitchen. Their voices carried through the thin walls.

"—heard at the bar that Mitchell's been quoting scripture at the girl all week," Frank said. "Honor thy father, don't be unequally yoked, that sort of thing."

"She's seventeen, Frank. Of course she's upset."

"Being upset doesn't change biblical law. Mitchell's within his rights as her father and her pastor." Frank's voice was surprisingly thoughtful—maybe the whiskey made him philosophical. "Boy like Tommy, girl like that... it was never going to work anyway."

"Tommy's a good boy."

"Good boys from bad places are still from bad places. You think Mitchell wants his daughter married to a railroad worker? Wants grandkids from the wrong side of the tracks?" Frank laughed, bitter. "Smart man, the pastor. Nipping it before it goes too far."

I stopped listening. Went to my room and stared at the ceiling until dinner, Frank's words echoing. Boy like Tommy, girl like that... it was never going to work anyway.

The entire town agreed, apparently. From different angles, for different reasons, but the conclusion was the same. Grace belonged on her side of the tracks. I belonged on mine. Pastor Mitchell was right to enforce that division.

Sunday morning, my mother insisted we all go to church. We usually only went for Easter and Christmas, but Ma said the family needed to show our faces, needed to prove we were decent people despite the gossip.

I tried to refuse. She wouldn't hear it.

So I found myself in the back pew of Pastor Mitchell's church, wearing my only suit that was too tight in the shoulders, my black eye faded to sickly yellow-green. The bruises made old Mrs. Henderson gasp when she saw me, then quickly look away.

Pastor Mitchell's sermon was about obedience to parental authority. About children honoring fathers and mothers. About the wisdom of age and experience, how young people often mistake rebellion for righteousness.

He never looked at me. Didn't need to. Everyone in that church knew who the sermon was really for.

I spotted Grace in the third row, sitting between her parents. Even from the back, I could see the rigid set of her shoulders. She didn't turn around once during the entire service, though I willed her to. Just sat perfectly still, perfectly obedient.

Perfectly miserable.

After the service, people filed out slowly, shaking Pastor Mitchell's hand at the door. My family hung back, and I thought maybe we could slip out a side door. But Ma wanted to be proper, wanted to show we had manners and respect.

We joined the line.

Grace was standing with her mother on the church lawn when I came out. She wore a blue dress with a white collar, her hair pulled back neatly. She looked tired. Thinner than I remembered, like she hadn't been sleeping or eating right.

Our eyes met across twenty feet of grass and gravel.

For one long moment, neither of us looked away. Her face was pale, eyes red-rimmed like she'd been crying recently. Or maybe she cried often now. The thought made my chest ache.

I wanted to go to her. Wanted to ask if she was okay, if she needed anything, if she thought about me the way I thought about her—constantly, painfully, like a bruise that wouldn't heal.

But her father stood ten feet away, shaking hands with Mr. Henderson. Her mother had her hand on Grace's arm, gentle but firm. A reminder of who Grace belonged to, who got to make decisions about her life.

Not me. Never me.

I looked away first. Turned and followed my parents to our truck, parked at the far edge of the lot where vehicles from our neighborhood always ended up.

"That was the Mitchell girl, wasn't it?" Ma asked quietly as we drove away. "The one you've been helping at the center?"

"Yeah."

"She looked unhappy."

"Yeah."

Ma didn't push. We rode home in silence, the railroad tracks appearing and disappearing as we crossed them, solid and immutable as the social order they represented.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about Grace standing on that church lawn. Thought about the gossip I'd heard all week, piecing together the arguments she'd had with her father. She'd tried to defend me. Tried to argue that judging people by neighborhood violated their faith's teachings.

But Pastor Mitchell had scripture on his side. Had parental authority. Had the weight of social expectation and an entire congregation's agreement. What did Grace have? Just her own conviction that I was better than my circumstances.

And conviction doesn't win against authority. Not when you're seventeen and you've been raised to obey, to honor, to submit to wisdom greater than your own.

Grace had bowed to her father's will. Had accepted his biblical arguments and social reasoning. Had chosen obedience over rebellion, duty over desire.

I couldn't blame her. Wouldn't blame her.

She'd never openly defied her father before. Why would she start now, for a boy who'd proved Pastor Mitchell's point by fighting in a parking lot full of children?

The space between us had been measured in railroad tracks and social class. Now it was measured in biblical authority and parental decree. Either way, the distance was too great to cross.

Grace stayed on her side. I stayed on mine.

Exactly like her father wanted. Exactly like everyone expected.

Exactly like it had to be.

Even if we both looked miserable about it.
