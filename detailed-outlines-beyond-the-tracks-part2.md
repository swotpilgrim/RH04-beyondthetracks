Mrs. Mitchell and church committee ladies visiting to observe center's work, discussing potential church support. Grace teaching inside, professional and perfect. Tommy doing maintenance outside, aware Grace's mother is watching.

- Tommy confronts Eddie immediately, tells him to get out or he'll throw him out. Eddie loud, playing to crowd, says Tommy's got no authority—just janitor playing hero. Tommy tells Eddie final warning to leave. Eddie shoves Tommy, insults him, calls him traitor to neighborhood. Tommy shoves back.
- Eddie throws first punch. They fight—hard, violent, drawing huge crowd. Kids screaming, Mrs. Kowalski trying to stop them. Tommy's defending Danny, protecting center, but to onlookers it's just another rough kid from wrong neighborhood fighting. Looks like he's exactly what they think.

Police don't come but everyone saw. Mrs. Mitchell witnessed everything, looks appalled. Tommy realizes he's just confirmed every bad assumption about him. Grace won't meet his eyes.

**POV:** Tommy Keane, first person  
**Setting:** Community center, main room  
**Time:** Monday afternoon, following the fight

**Purpose:** Grace delivers news that her father forbids her from center and from Tommy, creating the separation.

**Beats:**
- Tommy doesn't go to center Sunday after fight, knows he should stay away. Monday afternoon returns reluctantly to check on Danny, afraid Eddie's gotten to him. Finds Grace there but she's different—distant, formal, won't look at him directly.
- Grace pulls Tommy aside, tells him her father forbids her from coming to center anymore. Pastor Mitchell heard about fight from Mrs. Mitchell and other witnesses. Convinced Tommy is dangerous, bad influence, exactly the kind of boy Grace should avoid. Sees whole situation as Grace getting in over her head with "those people."
- Grace tried arguing—explaining Tommy was protecting Danny, that Eddie's the real threat—but her father wouldn't hear it. He's heard rumors about time Grace and Tommy spend together, people have talked. Pastor's frightened for Grace's safety and reputation. Sees Tommy as representative of everything Grace should avoid—violence, rough background, wrong neighborhood.
- Grace's mother tried mediating but ultimately supports husband. Grace is forbidden from center, from that neighborhood, from Tommy. She's crying when she tells him, clearly wants to defy father but doesn't know how. Has never openly disobeyed him before.
- Tommy tells her it's fine, better this way, she should listen to her father. Grace says that's not what she wants. Tommy says what she wants doesn't matter—he's not good for her, never was. Everyone was right about him including her father. Grace protests but Tommy cuts her off, says she should go. Walks away before she can see how much this is destroying him.

**Dialogue Topics:** Grace's difficult delivery of her father's decree. Details of Pastor Mitchell's reasoning and fears. Grace's attempted defense of Tommy that failed.

**POV:** Tommy Keane, first person  
**Setting:** Various locations—Tommy doesn't witness but hears through small-town gossip  
**Time:** Days following forbidden decree

**Purpose:** Show Grace's internal struggle between father's authority and her own desires, ultimately bowing to expectation despite her feelings.

**Beats:**
- Tommy doesn't witness Grace's arguments with her father but hears about them—small town, word travels fast. Marty mentions hearing from someone whose sister works at church that Grace and Pastor Mitchell had huge argument. Others chime in with details, third-hand accounts that Tommy pieces together.
- Grace insisted Tommy's not who her father thinks—he's kind, smart, good with kids, was protecting Danny from real threat. Pastor Mitchell says Tommy may have good moments but still from rough background, still got into public fight, still represents danger Grace should avoid. Fight proved his nature.
- Grace argued judging people by neighborhood violates everything their faith teaches about loving neighbor, seeing Christ in everyone. Pastor Mitchell says it's not prejudice—it's wisdom and protection. He loves Grace, wants best for her, and Tommy Keane from wrong side of tracks isn't it.
- Pastor Mitchell invokes parental authority, biblical obedience, Grace's duty as daughter. Uses scripture about honoring parents, about not being unequally yoked, about avoiding appearance of evil. Grace never openly defied father, never questioned his authority. Perfect daughter her whole life. Torn between freedom Tommy represents and obedience she's been raised to.
- Ultimately Grace bows to father's will. Stops coming to center completely. Tommy sees her once from distance in church parking lot Sunday—she looks miserable, almost looks his way then quickly away. He forces himself to look away too, tells himself this is how it should be.

**Dialogue Topics:** Third-hand accounts of Grace's arguments that Tommy hears through gossip. Details of Pastor Mitchell's scriptural justifications. Grace's protests about prejudice and real character. Tommy's internal dialogue processing each piece of information.

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words  
**POV:** Tommy Keane, first person  
**Setting:** Railroad yard, Tommy's home, his bedroom  
**Time:** Week following Grace's capitulation

**Purpose:** Tommy processes heartbreak through lens of resigned "I knew this would happen," reinforcing his belief he deserves nothing better.

**Beats:**
- Tommy heartbroken but not surprised—part of him almost relieved. The waiting is over, the inevitable finally arrived. He was stupid to let himself hope, to think pastor's daughter could be with railroad worker from wrong neighborhood. Should have known better from start.
- Throws himself into railroad work with vengeance. Loading freight cars, losing himself in physical labor until body aches too much to think. Works double shifts. Comes home exhausted, falls into bed without eating. Marty notices Tommy's mood darkening, asks what's wrong. Tommy won't talk about it.
- At home, Frank drunk and bitter one night, makes cutting comment about Tommy moping around. Asks if some girl finally figured out she's too good for him. Tommy nearly punches wall but controls himself. Goes to his room instead.
- Lies awake nights thinking about Grace despite trying not to. Remembers her laugh with kids, how she looked at him in storage room, way she saw him like he was worth something. Realizes he fell harder than he admitted to himself. Keeps replaying moments—discussing poetry, almost kissing in heat, her hand touching his.
- Tommy's internal monologue bitter and resigned. She's gone back to her world where she belongs, he's stuck on his side of tracks. Exactly where everyone always said he belonged. World makes sense again—wrong side of tracks boys don't get pastor's daughters. Natural order restored. Tells himself to forget her, knows he won't.

**Dialogue Topics:** Brief, rough workplace exchanges at rail yard. Marty's concerned questions Tommy deflects. Frank's drunk, cutting observations. Mostly Tommy's internal dialogue—bitter, hurt, resigned. Conversations with himself about what he should have known, what he briefly let himself hope, what he's lost.

**Emotional Arc:** Tommy moves from acute heartbreak to numb resignation. Channels pain into physical exhaustion. His father's comment opens wound wider. Night thoughts reveal depth of his feelings and pain. Ends accepting this outcome as inevitable, reinforcing his belief he deserves his limited lot in life.

**Key Details:** Exhausting physical labor as emotional escape. Double shifts, skipped meals, punishing his body. Father's drunk cruelty hitting too close. Sleepless nights in small bedroom. Specific memories of Grace that haunt him. Railroad yard as refuge and prison. His resigned acceptance as defense mechanism against deeper pain.

**Setting:** Railroad yard, Tommy's truck, community center parking lot  
**Time:** Final week of August

**Purpose:** Tommy stops going to center completely, giving up on everything Grace made him believe about himself, accepting his limited fate.

**Beats:**
- Tommy stops going to community center entirely. Tells himself it's better this way—for Grace, for him, for everyone. Goes straight home from rail yard, avoiding neighborhood where center is. Danny Porter comes to railroad yard one afternoon looking for him. Kid tracked him down to ask why Tommy isn't coming around anymore.
- Tommy says he's busy with work, needs extra shifts. Danny's not stupid—knows it's about Grace, about the fight, about Tommy giving up. Danny says kids miss him, center's not the same. Mrs. Kowalski asked about him. Tommy tells Danny to keep his head down, stay away from Eddie and crew, listen to Mrs. Kowalski. Good advice he can't follow himself.
- Danny asks if Tommy's giving up. Question hits harder than expected. Tommy says he's not giving up, he's being realistic. Danny looks disappointed in him—that look hurts more than anything. Kid leaves. Tommy returns to loading freight cars, trying not to think about disappointment in Danny's eyes.
- At rail yard, Tommy works extra shifts, exhausting himself so he won't think. Keeps finding himself staring at trains heading out of town, thinking about elsewhere. Marty finally tells him he's working himself to death. Tommy says at least he'll die useful. Marty calls him on self-pity but Tommy won't engage.
- Tommy starts believing what everyone's always said about him—he's good for loading freight, fixing things, nothing more. Grace was beautiful fantasy he should never have entertained. Railroad tracks divide town for good reason. Some people cross them, most don't. Tommy needs to accept his side and stop wanting more. Walls back up, protective numbness settling in. Ends completely resigned, shut down emotionally, accepting his fate.

**Dialogue Topics:** Brief exchange with Danny about why Tommy stopped coming to center. Tommy's hollow advice to Danny. Danny's accusation Tommy's giving up. Marty's blunt observation Tommy's killing himself with work. Tommy's bitter responses. Internal dialogue most important—his acceptance of limitations, his self-condemnation, his conviction Grace was impossible dream.

**Emotional Arc:** Tommy moves from deliberate avoidance to complete resignation. Danny's disappointment cuts through numbness briefly then reinforces it. Extra work as punishment and escape. Watching trains leave while he stays. Ends fully shut down, walls rebuilt stronger than before, believing everyone was right about his limitations all along.

**Key Details:** Railroad yard as only world now. Danny's unexpected appearance and disappointed face. Trains leaving as symbol of escape he can't take. Extra shifts and physical exhaustion. Marty's concern Tommy won't accept. Complete cessation of center involvement. Protective numbness replacing pain. Railroad tracks as permanent metaphorical and literal division he's accepted. His resigned belief this is all he deserves or will ever have.

**Setting:** Various locations in Copper Ridge - Tommy observes from distance  
**Time:** First week of September, leading to revival meeting

**Purpose:** Show Grace's misery and internal conflict through Tommy's distant observations, while he remains resigned to separation.

**Beats:**
- Grace is miserable without Tommy and center work. Tommy sees evidence everywhere despite staying away—hears from Marty whose girlfriend knows church ladies who report Grace seems unhappy. Town gossip network provides unwanted updates. Grace attends church functions, helps mother with ladies' auxiliary, plays perfect daughter but something's wrong.
- Tommy sees her twice from distance. Once at church parking lot Sunday—she looks pale, thinner, going through motions. Once from his truck when he's driving past her house—she's sitting on porch alone, staring at nothing. Both times he forces himself to keep driving, doesn't stop or approach. Tells himself her unhappiness will fade, she'll be fine without him.
- Mrs. Kowalski comes to rail yard one afternoon, tells Tommy Grace's mother Sarah came to center asking about him. Wanted to know what kind of person he really was. Mrs. Kowalski told her truth—Tommy's good with kids, reliable, kind beneath rough exterior. Sarah listened thoughtfully, didn't argue. Tommy doesn't know what this means.
- Hears through town grapevine that annual summer revival meeting is upcoming—big community event at Riverside Park. Everyone attends. Tommy's mother mentions their family should go, his father grumbles but agrees. Tommy knows Grace will be there with her family, prominent in front section. Decides he won't go or will stay far in back where she won't see him.
- Tommy lies awake thinking about Grace despite trying not to. Wonders if she thinks about him, if she regrets their time together or sees it as mistake she escaped. Wonders if her unhappiness is temporary or if she feels this hollowness he feels. Tells himself to stop wondering, to let her go. Can't make himself do it.

**Dialogue Topics:** Mrs. Kowalski's report of Sarah Mitchell's questions and her honest answers. Tommy's mother's casual mention of revival meeting.

**POV:** Tommy Keane, first person  
**Setting:** Railroad yard, Tommy's home, late night  
**Time:** Days before revival meeting, early September

**Purpose:** Tommy fully embraces belief everyone was right about him—he's limited, unworthy, destined for this life and nothing more.

**Beats:**
- Early September, Tommy completely shut down emotionally. Works double shifts at railroad constantly. Comes home exhausted, barely speaks to family. Frank makes comment one night about Tommy being just like him—working himself to death for nothing, no future beyond this. Tommy doesn't argue because he's starting to believe it completely.
- Everything everyone's always said about him was right. He's rough, limited, destined for railroad work until his back breaks. Grace was beautiful dream but dreams don't change reality. Wrong side of tracks isn't just location—it's permanent state of being. The fight with Eddie proved his nature. Pastor Mitchell was right to protect his daughter.
- Marty finally confronts Tommy at Joe's Diner after shift. Says Tommy's acting like somebody died. Tommy says maybe somebody did—the version of himself that thought he could be more than this. Marty asks who told him that. Tommy lists everyone—teachers, father, town, now Grace's father too. Marty calls it self-pity. Tommy says it's acceptance.
- Mrs. Kowalski comes to rail yard again, asks Tommy to come back to center. Kids need him, Danny's struggling without his influence, Eddie's been sniffing around again. Tommy refuses. Says kids will be fine, they don't need him. Mrs. Kowalski looks disappointed, tells him he's better than this resignation. Tommy doesn't answer—doesn't believe her anymore.
- That night Tommy stares at ceiling, listening to trains. Thinks about Grace seeing him as more than he is. She was wrong. Everyone else was right. He's Tommy Keane, railroad worker, rough kid from wrong neighborhood. That's all he'll ever be. Moment with Grace was aberration, brief fantasy where he pretended. Now back to reality. Ends fully believing everyone's low assessment of him was accurate all along.

**Dialogue Topics:** Frank's bitter observation about their shared limited future. Marty's confrontation about giving up. Tommy's litany of people who've told him he's nothing. Mrs. Kowalski's plea to return and his refusal. Tommy's internal monologue most important—complete self-condemnation and acceptance of limitations.

**Emotional Arc:** Tommy descends from numbness to active self-hatred disguised as acceptance. Each confrontation reinforces his conviction he was foolish to hope. Refusing Mrs. Kowalski marks his complete withdrawal. Ends believing everyone was right about him—he's worthless beyond physical labor.

**Key Details:** Double shifts as self-punishment. Father's bitter wisdom hitting home. Diner confrontation with Marty. Mrs. Kowalski's second attempt to reach him failing.

**Setting:** Riverside Park during annual summer revival meeting  
**Time:** Sunday afternoon, mid-September

**Purpose:** Establish revival meeting setting and build tension toward Grace's public stand, showing Tommy's reluctant presence and their visual connection.

**Beats:**
- Mid-September brings annual summer revival meeting—big community event at Riverside Park along river. Families from both sides of tracks attend though they don't mix much. Tommy's family goes because mother insists, says it's community obligation. Tommy tries refusing but mother won't hear it. Argues it looks bad if they don't attend.
- Tommy stands far in back with Marty, arms crossed, not listening to preaching. Pastor Mitchell leads service from makeshift platform, talks about community, Christian love, acceptance, loving thy neighbor. Tommy finds it bitterly ironic—man preaches acceptance but won't accept him near his daughter.
- Scans crowd despite himself. Sees Grace sitting front section with her mother, perfect posture, modest dress. Even from distance looks beautiful and miserable. Their eyes meet across crowd. Grace holds his gaze—something desperate, determined in her expression. Tommy quickly looks away, heart pounding.
- Service shifts—Pastor Mitchell opens floor for testimonies and reflections about faith, community, gratitude. Awkward silence, then people start sharing. Standard testimonies about blessings, faith sustaining them, gratitude for community. Older woman thanks church for support during husband's illness. Young man talks about finding purpose through youth group.
- Then Grace stands up. Tommy's heart stops. Everyone turns to look at pastor's daughter. Grace walks to front, stands before entire congregation. Pastor Mitchell looks surprised but encouraging, clearly thinking she'll share something appropriate about youth group or summer volunteering. Instead Grace begins speaking about judgment and hypocrisy. Chapter ends with beginning of her speech, Tommy frozen in shock.

**POV:** Tommy Keane, first person  
**Setting:** Riverside Park, continuation of revival meeting  
**Time:** Immediately following previous chapter

**Purpose:** Grace publicly challenges congregation's hypocrisy and judgment, speaking truth about class prejudice while carefully not naming Tommy.

**Beats:**
- Grace's voice shakes at first but strengthens as she speaks. Addresses congregation directly about preaching Christian love while practicing exclusion. They divide themselves by neighborhood, family name, assumptions about who people are based on where they live. Teach forgiveness and redemption but don't practice it.
- Grace talks about her summer volunteering at community center in "wrong neighborhood." Met kids who are smart, kind, deserving—but written off before they have chance. Saw real faith and character in people congregation dismisses. Names no names but everyone understands she means Tommy and his neighborhood.
- She speaks about seeing through prejudice to real people. Says sometimes most Christian thing is truly seeing others, not through assumptions. Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners, didn't restrict love to respectable people. Her voice cracks with emotion but she continues.
- Grace looks directly at her father when she says they preach about not judging by appearances but judge constantly by address and family name. Says she's tired of performing perfection when what matters is being honest and kind. Admits perfect pastor's daughter act has kept her from being real person, from seeing real people.
- Finishes by saying maybe they should all examine whose opinions they value more—people who judge by externals or God who looks at heart. Sits down shaking. Silence. Margaret Walsh looks scandalized. Some people shift uncomfortably. But others nod slowly—including surprisingly few parents from Tommy's neighborhood who rarely attend. Then Sarah Mitchell stands and starts clapping. Slowly others join. Mixed response—some approval, some shock, some anger.

**Dialogue Topics:** Grace's entire speech—careful language about judgment and hypocrisy, her summer experiences, unnamed but clear references, scriptural references about Jesus and outcasts, challenge to examine their prejudices. Silence following. Sarah Mitchell's supportive clapping. Murmured responses varied by congregation member.

**Emotional Arc:** Tommy goes from frozen shock to increasing emotion as Grace speaks. Realizes she's standing up for him, for their connection, for truth despite cost. Her courage awes him.

**Purpose:** Grace finds Tommy in parking lot and declares she's done letting others decide who she cares about, forcing him to respond.

**Beats:**
- After Grace's speech, chaos. Some congregation members approach Grace supportively, agreeing quietly they needed to hear this. Others avoid her, whispering to each other. Margaret Walsh loudly tells Sarah Mitchell that speech was inappropriate, presumptuous. Pastor Mitchell stands silent, shaken—proud his daughter spoke with conviction but troubled by public challenge.
- Tommy slips out to parking lot, standing by his truck trying to process what just happened. Grace spoke up for him, for them, in front of entire town. Put herself and her reputation at risk. Heart pounding, emotions overwhelming after weeks of numbness.
- Grace finds him in parking lot. Walks straight to him despite everyone watching from distance. Asks if he heard. Tommy says yes, everyone heard. Grace says she meant every word. Can't stay silent anymore, can't keep performing.
- Tommy tells her she didn't have to do that, she's made things harder for herself. Town will talk, her father's hurt and angry, she's damaged her position. Grace says she couldn't live with silence anymore, with pretending. Says she's done letting fear of disappointment control her choices, done letting others decide who she can care about.
- Tommy's walls cracking but still up. Tells her she doesn't know what she's asking for. Being with him means judgment, difficulty, her family upset, town gossip. Grace steps closer, says being without him has been worse than any of that. Tommy tells her he's terrified of disappointing her, of being exactly the guy everyone warned her about—rough, limited, wrong for her. Grace says he's not that guy, he's better than he believes. People watching them from distance but Grace doesn't care. Tommy realizes she's serious, she's choosing this despite all costs.

**Dialogue Topics:** Grace's declaration she meant her speech. Tommy's concern for consequences she'll face. Grace's statement she's done letting others control her.

Sarah Mitchell works quietly on husband, gently pointing out his own prejudices, reminding him of grace and redemption he preaches.
- Tommy avoids Grace despite her speech, still convinced he'll ruin her life eventually. Returns reluctantly to community center when Mrs. Kowalski guilts him—kids have been asking for him constantly, especially Danny. Eddie's been circling again. Tommy can't abandon the kids.
- Grace is there when Tommy arrives. She's been waiting for him. They need to talk. Tommy tells her he appreciates what she did but it doesn't change reality. He's still railroad worker with no future. She's still pastor's daughter with bright possibilities. Together they face judgment, difficulty, her family's disappointment. Worth it? 
- Grace asks if he cares about her. Tommy admits he does, more than he should. Grace asks if he thinks she's worth fighting for. Tommy says of course she is. Grace asks then why doesn't he think he's worth fighting for? Why does he believe everyone's low opinion more than her assessment? Question stops Tommy cold—no good answer.
- Grace tells him she's not asking him to be perfect, just to try. To believe he deserves more than resignation and limitations. Says his biggest obstacle isn't her father or town judgment—it's his own belief he's not worthy. Tommy realizes she's right. He's been his own worst enemy, accepting everyone's low expectations.

**Beats:**

- Frank tells Tommy he's been hard on him, pushed him down because Frank's own life didn't turn out how he wanted.

- Tommy finds Grace at center. She's reading to small group of kids but stops when she sees him walk in carrying Whitman book openly. Her face lights up with hope and question. Tommy waits until reading session ends, then approaches.
- Tells Grace he's been scared—of disappointing her, of proving everyone right about him, of being not enough. But staying scared means staying small, means accepting limitations everyone else set for him. Grace made him see he could be more, but he has to believe it himself. He does now.
- Says he's not perfect, probably never will be. Still rough around edges, still from wrong side of tracks, still loading freight cars for living. But he's also thoughtful, caring, trying. He reads poetry and protects kids and wants more from life than resignation. Contains multitudes like Whitman said. All of that is real.
- Tommy tells Grace he can't promise easy path. Her father might never fully accept him. Town will judge. He doesn't have money or prospects or respectable future lined up. But he cares about her more than he's cared about anything. She makes him want to be better—not different, better. More fully himself. Will try every day if she'll let him.
- Grace is crying and smiling. Says that's all she wants, just him trying. They stand in center's main room, Danny and other kids watching curiously. Tommy takes Grace's hand publicly, clearly. Tells her he sees her too—not perfect pastor's daughter performing role but real person who's brave and kind and sees good in people others dismiss. Says maybe they can be real together. Grace says yes. They're about to kiss when kids start making noise, catcalls and giggles. Tommy laughs, pulls back. Says they should probably talk to her father first. Grace agrees but squeezes his hand. They're together now, publicly, really.

**Dialogue Topics:** Tommy's declaration he's ready to try. His honest assessment of what he can and can't offer. Grace's response that trying is enough. Tommy's statement he sees her truly. Kids' reactions interrupting moment. Agreement to talk to her father together. Their commitment despite obstacles.

**Emotional Arc:** Tommy moves from nervous approach to vulnerable honesty to commitment. Grace responds with relief and joy. Both acknowledge obstacles but choose each other anyway. Kids' interruption adds lightness to serious moment. Ends with them committed and ready to face her father together.

**Key Details:** Center as witnessing space. Whitman book Tommy carries openly. Grace's lit-up face seeing him. Kids as audience to their reunion. Hand-holding as public declaration. Almost-kiss interrupted humorously. Agreement to face father together as united front. Tommy's full honest speech about what he is and isn't. Grace's acceptance of all of it.

- But he cares about Grace, respects her, wants to be worthy of her faith in him. Won't pretend to be perfect but will try to be good. Will keep helping at center, plans to finish high school equivalency through night classes, work toward more. Not asking for approval, just asking Pastor Mitchell to let Grace make her own choice.
- Grace speaks up, tells father she loves him but won't let his fears control her life anymore. She's choosing Tommy not to rebel but because Tommy sees and values her truly as person, not as role. Asks father to trust her judgment. Sarah touches husband's hand, reminds him about redemption and second chances he preaches about.
- Pastor Mitchell struggles visibly—seeing Tommy as individual rather than symbol of everything he fears is hard. Long silence. Asks Tommy what he wants from life.

Pastor Mitchell studies him, finally says he won't forbid relationship but Tommy better prove himself worthy of daughter's faith. They shake hands—not warm approval but acknowledgment.

## Chapter 30: Choosing To Be

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words  
**POV:** Tommy Keane, first person  
**Setting:** Beyond railroad tracks at river's edge, then walking back to town  
**Time:** Evening, late September

**Purpose:** Tommy and Grace commit to their future together, understanding worthiness is choice not circumstance, ending with hopeful happy beginning.

**Beats:**
- Late September evening after tense meeting with Pastor Mitchell. Tommy and Grace walk beyond railroad tracks to where town meets river—border between their two worlds, neutral territory. Sit on riverbank as sun sets, talking about future and what comes next.
- Tommy enrolled in night classes for high school equivalency. Grace planning to attend teacher's college, wants to work with underserved kids after seeing center's impact. They make no grand promises because they're young and uncertain, but they commit to trying together, to seeing each other truly, to not letting others' expectations trap them anymore.
- Tommy tells Grace about Whitman poem he's been rereading—"Song of the Open Road." Quotes lines about taking open road, claiming yourself, choosing your path regardless of what others say you should be. Says that's what they're doing—choosing themselves first, choosing each other second, choosing more than what others decided for them.
- Grace says being worthy isn't about where you're from or what others expect. It's about who you choose to be, what you try for, whether you're willing to be truly seen. Tommy realizes he's spent life hiding—hiding poetry, hiding intelligence, hiding hope, hiding behind "rough kid" role that protected him. With Grace he can be visible, be multiple things simultaneously. Railroad worker and poetry reader. Tough and tender. From wrong side of tracks and worthy of love.
- They kiss for first time—sweet and passionate, beyond tracks where their worlds meet. First kiss tender then deepening. When they pull apart, both smiling. Tommy feels something he hasn't felt before: hope. Not certainty, but possibility. They walk back toward town together holding hands, knowing difficulty ahead but choosing it anyway.

**Dialogue Topics:** Plans for future—night classes, college, working with kids. Discussion of Whitman's "Song of the Open Road" and claiming your own path.

Commitment to trying as mature happy ending. Love and choice mattering more than geography or circumstance. Final image of them together, choosing their path.
