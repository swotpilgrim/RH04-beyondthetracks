# Chapter 7: Falling and Scared

I realized I was falling for Grace Mitchell on a Tuesday afternoon in late June, and it terrified me.

I was fixing the screen door—the one that stuck every time someone tried to open it—when she laughed at something one of the kids said. Just a laugh, nothing special. But the sound cut through the noise of the center and hit me square in the chest.

And I knew.

I'd been lying to myself for weeks, telling myself I was just being helpful, just doing my job, just tolerating the new volunteer from the right side of town. But standing there with a screwdriver in my hand, listening to Grace laugh, I couldn't pretend anymore.

I was falling for her. Maybe had already fallen.

And that scared me more than anything in my life ever had.

Because once I admitted it to myself, I couldn't stop noticing things. Little things that added up to something too big to ignore.

The way she pushed her hair behind her ear when she was concentrating on something. She did it without thinking, a small gesture that shouldn't have mattered but somehow did. I found myself watching for it, waiting for it.

Her laugh—the real one, not the polite one she used with adults. When the kids made her genuinely laugh, her whole face changed. Lit up. She'd throw her head back slightly, unselfconscious and bright.

How she bit her lip when she was thinking hard about something. How her voice got softer when she was talking to Maria or one of the shyer kids. How she always said "please" and "thank you" like they actually meant something, not just automatic politeness.

The way she looked at me sometimes, like she was trying to figure something out. Like I was a puzzle worth solving.

That one was the most dangerous.

I started cataloging these observations without meaning to. Stored them away like stolen treasures. The flower scent of her soap or perfume, whatever it was. The neat way she organized her books. How she always wore dresses, modest ones with proper hems and sleeves, but in colors that made her stand out—yellow, green, blue.

How she'd started seeking me out, asking questions, having conversations that lasted longer than they should.

How comfortable I'd gotten talking to her.

That last one made me realize how far I'd let this go. So I tried to pull back.

Thursday afternoon, Grace arrived while I was working on the plumbing under the kitchen sink. I heard her greeting Mrs. Kowalski, heard her footsteps approaching.

"Hi, Tommy."

I didn't look up from the pipe I was tightening. "Hey."

"How's it going?"

"Fine."

A pause. "Do you need any help?"

"Nope."

"Okay. Let me know if you do."

She walked away. I forced myself not to watch her go.

Saturday morning, same thing. Grace arrived for story time, found me repairing one of the tables.

"Morning, Tommy."

"Morning."

"Beautiful day, isn't it?"

"I guess."

Another pause, longer this time. "Are you okay?"

I finally looked up. She was watching me with concern in her eyes, and that made my chest hurt worse.

"I'm fine."

"You seem distant lately. Did I do something to upset you?"

"No."

"Are you sure? Because—"

"I'm just tired, Grace. Long hours at the yard."

It wasn't entirely a lie. The rail yard was always exhausting. But that wasn't why I was being short with her, and I think she knew it.

"Oh. Okay." She looked like she wanted to say more but didn't. "Well, I hope you get some rest."

"Thanks."

She left me alone after that. I should've felt relieved. Instead, I felt like I'd kicked a puppy.

The day dragged on. I worked through my list of repairs, keeping busy, keeping my distance. Every time Grace laughed or called one of the kids over, I was aware of exactly where she was in the building. Couldn't stop myself from tracking her movements, even while telling myself to stop.

When she left that afternoon, she waved goodbye to Mrs. Kowalski and the kids. She glanced my way, seemed like she might say something, then didn't. Just gave a small smile and walked out.

I watched through the window as she got into her father's black sedan, watched it pull away down the street. Watched until it was out of sight.

That night, I couldn't sleep.

I lay in my narrow bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the train whistles and my father's snoring through the wall. The window was open, trying to catch any breeze in the muggy heat, but the air sat heavy and still.

And I couldn't stop thinking about Grace.

Her face when I'd been short with her. The concern in her voice when she'd asked if she upset me. The small smile she'd given before leaving, trying to be gracious even though I'd been cold.

I rolled over, punched my pillow, tried to force my brain to shut up and let me sleep.

Instead, it started its litany of all the reasons this was impossible.

Grace Mitchell was Pastor Mitchell's daughter. The pastor's only daughter. She lived in that nice two-story house near the church on the right side of the tracks. She'd grown up with everything I'd never had—comfort, security, respect, a future with possibilities.

She wore clean dresses and new shoes. She went to church every Sunday. She'd probably go to college, maybe become a teacher or marry some boy from a good family and have a nice life in a nice house with nice kids.

And I was Tommy Keane from the wrong side of the tracks. I dropped out of school at sixteen. I loaded freight cars for thirty-eight dollars a week and gave most of it to my mother because my father's injury meant we were always scraping by. I had coal dust and oil so deep under my nails that no amount of scrubbing got it all out.

I lived in a house where the paint peeled and the windows shook when trains went by. My father drank too much and told me I'd never amount to anything. My future was loading freight until my back gave out like his, living in the same neighborhood where I'd grown up, dying in the same small life I was already living.

What did I have to offer someone like Grace?

Nothing.

Less than nothing.

If people found out she was spending time with me—really spending time, not just volunteering in the same building—it would damage her reputation. People would talk. They'd say she was slumming, rebelling against her father, making poor choices. They'd question her judgment. Her father would be embarrassed, maybe angry.

And eventually, she'd realize they were right. Eventually, she'd see that whatever she thought she saw in me was just her imagination. That I was exactly what everyone else saw—rough, uneducated, going nowhere.

I'd disappoint her. It was inevitable.

Better to disappoint her now by keeping distance than later when it would hurt more.

I turned over again, the sheets tangling around my legs. The train whistle blew—the eleven-thirty freight passing through. Same whistle, every night. Same train, same tracks, same life.

But the ache in my chest wasn't the same.

Before Grace, I'd been resigned to my lot. Accepted it. The railroad tracks dividing Copper Ridge weren't just geography—they were reality. You stayed on your side, knew your place, didn't want what you couldn't have.

I'd made peace with that. Or thought I had.

Then Grace walked into the community center in her yellow dress, smiling at kids who nobody else cared about, treating me like my opinions mattered. And suddenly, staying on my side of the tracks felt less like acceptance and more like a cage.

But wanting out of the cage didn't mean I could get out. Wanting something didn't make it possible.

Wanting Grace didn't change who I was or where I came from.

I stared at the ceiling, at the water stain in the corner that had been there since I was a kid. Thought about Whitman's poetry—the open road, choosing your path, containing multitudes. Beautiful words about beautiful possibilities for people whose lives had room for choice.

Not for guys like me.

The truth was simple, hard as the rails I worked: Grace Mitchell and Tommy Keane lived in different worlds. We'd crossed paths for a summer in a rundown community center, but that was all it was. A temporary intersection. Soon enough, she'd go back to her world and I'd stay in mine, and this ache in my chest would fade.

It had to.

Because the alternative—letting myself believe this could be something real, letting myself care more than I already did—that was a kind of hope I couldn't afford.

Hope hurt worse than resignation ever could.

I finally fell asleep sometime after midnight, exhausted from fighting thoughts that wouldn't stop. And I dreamed about Grace's laugh, about how she looked at me like I was worth seeing, about the impossible distance between what I wanted and what I could have.

When the train whistle woke me at five-fifteen, I lay there for a moment before getting up for another day at the rail yard. Another day of the same.

And I told myself—again—that keeping Grace at a distance was the right thing to do. The smart thing. The only thing that made sense.

I'd say it as many times as I needed to until I believed it.

Even if believing it felt like slowly crushing something tender and hopeful inside my chest.

I got up, put on my work clothes, and headed to the kitchen. My father was already there, bitter and tired. My mother was making eggs. Mary was still asleep.

Another day. Another freight car to load. Another reminder of exactly who I was and what my life would be.

And somewhere across the railroad tracks, Grace was waking up in her clean house with her good family, getting ready for a day in a life I'd never be part of.

That was the truth. Hard and real as the steel rails I worked.

I needed to remember it.
