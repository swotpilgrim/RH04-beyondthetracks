# Chapter 16: Public Fight (MIDPOINT)

The center was busier than I'd ever seen it. Kids everywhere—shooting hoops outside, doing homework at tables, clustered around Grace for story time. Mrs. Kowalski moved between groups with efficient energy, straightening chairs and answering questions. The place hummed with productive chaos that made all the scraped-together funding feel worth it.

What made my shoulders tight was the other visitors. Mrs. Mitchell sat in the corner with three church ladies, watching with careful eyes that missed nothing. The church was considering financial support. These women were here to decide if we were worthy.

Grace was perfect with the kids, reading with animated voices that made them laugh. Professional. Poised. Everything a pastor's daughter should be. She caught my eye once and smiled, but it was careful. Her mother was twenty feet away, after all.

I stayed outside mostly, fixing the broken fence slat I'd been putting off. Honest work I could focus on while being painfully aware of the judgment happening inside. Mrs. Mitchell had been polite when she'd arrived, even thanked me for keeping the center maintained. But her eyes had assessed me the same way my foreman assessed damaged freight—trying to determine if I was worth salvaging or should be written off entirely.

I was hammering the last nail when I heard the rumble of Eddie's motorcycle.

My hands stilled. That engine sound was burned into my memory from years running with the crew. I turned slowly, hammer still gripped tight, and watched Eddie pull into the parking lot with three other guys. Tommy Rossi on another bike. Jake and Pete in Jake's beat-up Ford.

They parked dead center in the lot, deliberate as a slap. Eddie killed his engine and grinned at me, all teeth and bad intentions. He knew exactly what he was doing, showing up here with an audience.

"Keane," he called, swinging off his bike. "Heard you've been real busy playing hero."

I set down the hammer carefully. "Center's closed to you, Eddie. You know that."

"Public place, isn't it?" He looked around at the kids who'd stopped playing to stare. "Free country. Just came to talk to some friends."

He wasn't looking at me anymore. He was looking at Danny Porter, who'd frozen mid-shot with the basketball still in his hands. Danny was twelve, small for his age, hungry for belonging. Exactly Eddie's type.

My boots hit the asphalt before I'd consciously decided to move. "No."

Eddie's grin widened. "No what? Can't talk to the kid?"

"Not here. Not him." I positioned myself between Eddie and Danny, aware of how this looked—me squaring off in front of a center full of kids and church ladies. But I'd seen Eddie's recruitment pitch too many times. It always started friendly. Always ended with some kid too deep to get out.

"Hey, Danny." Eddie raised his voice, projecting past me. "You're getting big, man. What are you now, twelve? Thirteen?"

Danny didn't answer. Smart kid.

"Old enough to make some real money instead of playing these kid games." Eddie pulled out his wallet, made a show of thumbing through bills. "I could use someone quick. Smart. Just watching for me, nothing heavy. Twenty bucks for an afternoon. How's that sound?"

"Sounds like you need to leave." My voice came out harder than I'd meant, but fury was heating my blood. Twenty bucks was a fortune to a kid like Danny. Eddie knew that. "Now, Eddie."

"Or what?" Eddie stepped closer, and I could smell the cigarettes and cheap beer on him. "You gonna throw me out? You're just the janitor here, Tommy. You got no authority. Playing at being something you're not."

Behind me, I heard the center door open. Voices spilling out. I didn't turn to look, but I knew Grace had heard. Knew Mrs. Mitchell and the church ladies were probably watching.

"I'm telling you one last time." I kept my voice level despite the anger surging through me. "Leave Danny alone. Leave this center alone. Go back to wherever you came from."

"You think you're better than us now?" Eddie's voice rose, carrying across the lot. "Think because you read some books with the pretty church girl, you're not from the same gutter as the rest of us? You're a traitor, Keane. Forgot where you came from."

"I didn't forget anything." My hands had curled into fists without me noticing. "I just decided not to stay there."

"Yeah?" Eddie shoved me, both hands against my chest. Hard enough to make me stumble back a step. "Decided you're too good for your own people? That it?"

I shoved him back. "I decided not to drag kids down with me."

The words had barely left my mouth when Eddie's fist caught my jaw.

Pain exploded across my face, sharp and bright. I tasted blood. Then instinct took over—the instinct burned into me from years of fighting on these streets, proving myself to guys exactly like Eddie. My return punch caught him in the ribs, drove the air from his lungs in a whoosh.

Then we were grappling, fists flying, boots scraping asphalt. Eddie caught me with a hook to my eye that made stars burst in my vision. I drove my fist into his gut, once, twice. He grabbed my shirt and we went down hard, hitting the pavement in a tangle of limbs and fury.

Somewhere far away, kids were screaming. Mrs. Kowalski's voice shouted for us to stop. But I was beyond hearing, beyond thinking. Eddie was everything I was trying to escape, everything that wanted to pull me and Danny and every other kid back into the muck. He deserved every hit.

I landed a solid punch to his mouth. His blood joined mine, slick on my knuckles. He got his knee into my ribs and pain lanced through my side. We rolled, broke apart, came together again swinging.

"Stop it! Both of you, stop!"

That voice cut through the red haze. Grace's voice, high and frightened. I looked up without thinking.

She was standing ten feet away, both hands pressed to her mouth. Her face was white, eyes wide with shock and something worse—fear. Of me. Mrs. Kowalski was trying to pull her back. Behind them, Mrs. Mitchell and the church ladies clustered in the doorway, identical expressions of horror on their faces.

Danny stood frozen, basketball forgotten at his feet, watching me prove every adult who'd ever written him off right. Watching me be exactly what they'd said I was.

The fight went out of me like air from a punctured tire.

Eddie must have felt it. He shoved me hard, and I let myself fall back. Sat there on the pavement, breathing hard, pain beginning to register properly. My eye was already swelling. My ribs screamed. Blood dripped from my split lip onto my work shirt.

"That's what I thought." Eddie spat blood onto the asphalt next to me, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. His lip was split worse than mine, nose streaming blood. "You're just like us, Keane. Don't ever forget it."

He jerked his head at his crew. They backed toward their vehicles, engines starting with aggressive roars. Eddie straddled his bike, kicked it to life. Before he peeled out, he looked straight at Danny.

"Offer stands, kid. You know where to find me."

Then they were gone, leaving black tire marks on the asphalt and the stink of exhaust hanging in the afternoon air.

The silence afterward was worse than the fight.

I pushed myself to my feet, every movement sending fresh pain through my body. Didn't look at anyone. Couldn't look at Grace. If I saw that fear in her eyes again, something in me would break completely.

"Tommy." Mrs. Kowalski's voice was careful. "Are you—"

"I'm fine." I wasn't. "I'll go. Sorry for... sorry."

I finally forced myself to look at Grace. She'd lowered her hands from her mouth but hadn't moved. Hadn't come closer. The space between us felt like miles. Her expression had shifted from fear to something more complicated—confusion, maybe disappointment. She opened her mouth like she might say something, then closed it again.

Her mother stood behind her now, one hand on Grace's shoulder. Protective. The other church ladies whispered to each other, sharp little sounds that carried even if the words didn't. I caught "violence" and "those boys" and "exactly what Richard said."

That was Pastor Mitchell. What Richard said. What everyone had always said about guys like me from this side of the tracks.

I'd just proved them all right in the most public way possible.

"I'll send someone to finish the fence." I couldn't keep the roughness from my voice. Wasn't sure if it was from emotion or Eddie's fist to my throat. "Sorry for disrupting your visit, Mrs. Mitchell."

"Tommy—" Grace started, but I was already walking to my truck.

I could feel their eyes on my back. Could imagine the conversation that would happen as soon as I left. Could picture Pastor Mitchell's face when his wife told him about the violent boy from the wrong neighborhood fighting in front of children, in front of his daughter.

My hands shook as I started the engine. In the rearview mirror, I saw Grace still standing there, Mrs. Mitchell steering her back toward the center door. The church ladies had already disappeared inside, probably to discuss how centers in neighborhoods like this just attracted trouble.

I'd been trying to protect Danny. Trying to keep Eddie and his poison away from the kids.

But to everyone watching, I'd just been another rough kid from the wrong side of the tracks, solving problems with fists. Violent. Dangerous. Exactly what they'd expected.

I touched my swelling eye gingerly, wincing. My reflection looked back at me—bruised, bloody, rough.

I looked exactly like what I was. What I'd always been.

And now Grace had seen it too.

I pulled out of the parking lot, leaving the center and everything I'd hoped for behind. Eddie had won without even knowing it. He'd made me prove I was exactly what everyone thought. Made me confirm every warning Pastor Mitchell had probably given his daughter about boys like me.

The railroad tracks gleamed in the afternoon sun as I crossed them, heading back to my side of town. Back where I belonged.

Behind me, the center got smaller in my mirror until it disappeared completely.

Just like any chance I'd had with Grace.
