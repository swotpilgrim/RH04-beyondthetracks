# Chapter 10: Can't Stay Away

I knew I should stop spending time alone with Grace. Knew I should rebuild the walls I'd let crumble. Knew I should go back to being the maintenance guy who kept to himself and didn't get involved beyond fixing broken things.

I couldn't make myself do it.

Every time she came to the center, I found excuses to be near her. If she was inside teaching, I'd suddenly need to check the windows in that room. If she was outside with the kids, I'd remember urgent repairs to the basketball hoop or the back fence. I gravitated toward her like water flowing downhill—natural, inevitable, impossible to stop.

And she did the same.

We'd developed routines, unspoken but real. She'd bring me lemonade when I worked outside in the heat. I'd carry heavy supplies for her reading program without being asked. During the kids' basketball games, we'd both end up watching from the shade, standing close enough to talk.

These small rituals felt precious in a way I couldn't name.

Late July brought another wave of oppressive heat. The kind that made everything slow and sticky, where even breathing felt like effort. The rail yard was brutal, but at least I could hide in my truck at lunch. The center had fans but no air conditioning, and the old brick building held heat like an oven.

Thursday afternoon, I showed up already exhausted from my shift, my work shirt soaked through with sweat despite having driven here with the windows open. The kids were all outside, too hot to stay in the building. Danny and a handful of others were playing basketball, moving slower than usual in the heat.

Grace stood in the shade near the building, watching them. She'd pulled her hair up off her neck, and her pink dress looked wilted from the humidity. When she saw me, she smiled.

"Brutal out here," I said, joining her in the precious sliver of shade.

"I've never understood how you work in this. The center is bad enough."

"You get used to it."

"I don't think I would."

We stood there watching the kids play. Danny made a shot, and the others cheered half-heartedly, too hot for real enthusiasm. The ball bounced away and nobody rushed to retrieve it.

"I worry about them in this heat," Grace said quietly.

"They're tougher than they look."

"Still. Some of their houses don't have fans. Where do they go to cool off?"

"Fire hydrant, mostly. Someone usually opens one up when it gets this bad."

She looked thoughtful. "That doesn't seem safe."

"It's not. But it's what there is."

The casual conversation felt comfortable, natural. Like this was something we did all the time—stood in the shade together, talked about the kids, shared observations about the neighborhood. Like we were a team.

That thought should've scared me. Instead, it felt right.

"Can I ask you about your family?" Grace said after a moment.

I tensed slightly. "What about them?"

"You've mentioned your father's injury. And your sister. But I don't really know much about them."

I watched Danny line up another shot. "Not much to tell."

"I don't believe that."

I glanced at her. She was looking at me with that expression—genuinely interested, patient, willing to wait for an answer even if it took a while.

"My father worked the railroad his whole life," I said finally. "Like his father before him. He was good at it—strong, reliable. Then two years ago, he was lifting freight wrong and something in his back gave out. He's never been the same since."

"I'm sorry."

"He's bitter about it. Angry. Takes it out on my mother mostly, sometimes on me. Says I'm headed for the same fate—working myself to death for nothing."

"But you're not nothing. You help here, you read, you think about things—"

"He doesn't see it that way. To him, I'm just another Keane working the railroad. Following the family tradition into nowhere."

Grace was quiet for a moment. "And your mother?"

"She takes in laundry. Works from dawn to dark washing other people's clothes. Her hands are raw from it, but she never complains." I kicked at a stone near my foot. "She deserves better than what she got."

"What about your sister? Mary?"

A small smile crossed my face. "Mary's fourteen and smarter than anyone gives her credit for. She reads everything, gets perfect marks in school. But teachers look at her address and assume she'll drop out like I did. Like it's inevitable."

"Will she?"

"Not if I can help it. I give Ma extra money when I can, earmarked for Mary. So if she wants to stay in school, finish, maybe even go to college... she'll have a chance I didn't."

Grace's expression softened. "That's really admirable, Tommy."

I shrugged, uncomfortable with the praise. "It's just being decent."

"It's more than that."

We stood there in the shade, watching the kids, not talking for a minute. But the silence didn't feel awkward. Just comfortable.

"What about your family?" I asked. "You've mentioned the pressure, but what are they actually like?"

Grace pushed a stray strand of hair behind her ear. "My father loves me. I know he does. But sometimes I think he loves the idea of me more than the actual me. The perfect pastor's daughter who never questions, never doubts, never wants anything except what he wants for me."

"And your mother?"

"She's caught between us. Wants me to be happy, but also wants peace. It's easier for her if I just go along with what's expected."

"Sounds lonely."

Grace looked at me, surprise in her eyes. "Yes. That's exactly what it is. Lonely. Everyone thinks I have this perfect life, perfect family. But when you're not allowed to be yourself, when you have to perform all the time... you end up feeling alone even when you're surrounded by people."

"I get that."

"Do you?"

"Different reasons, but yeah. Feeling like nobody sees the real you. Like you're just playing a role everyone decided you should play."

"Yes." Her voice was soft. "Exactly that."

The kids called for water, and I went inside to bring out the jug Mrs. Kowalski kept in the refrigerator. When I came back, Grace was still standing in the shade. I poured water into paper cups, handed them out to the kids, then returned to my spot next to her.

Closer than before. Close enough that I could smell that flower scent despite the heat.

"You know what's funny?" Grace said.

"What?"

"You're the only person who's ever really asked about me. About what I want, what I feel. Everyone else just assumes they know."

"Maybe they're afraid of the answer."

"Maybe. Or maybe they just don't care to ask."

I looked at her. The afternoon sun caught her face, highlighting the small beads of sweat on her forehead, the flush in her cheeks from the heat. She looked real, human, nothing like the untouchable pastor's daughter I'd thought she was when we first met.

"You seem pretty perfect to me," I said before I could stop myself.

The words hung between us. Too honest. Too revealing.

Grace laughed, but it wasn't mocking. "That's exactly the problem. Everyone thinks I'm perfect, so nobody actually sees me."

"I see you."

The words came out quieter than I meant them. More intense.

Grace turned to face me fully. We were standing maybe two feet apart, the shade making the small space feel intimate despite the kids playing nearby.

"Do you?" she asked softly.

"Yeah. I see someone who's kind without trying to prove anything. Who asks real questions and listens to answers. Who's brave enough to work in a neighborhood everyone else from her side of town avoids. Who cares about kids society has written off."

Her eyes were locked on mine. "Tommy—"

"I see someone who's tired of being perfect and wants to just be real."

"Yes." The word was almost a whisper. "That's me. That's exactly me."

The air between us felt charged with something I couldn't name. Everything they weren't saying hung there—all the awareness, all the attraction, all the impossible wanting.

Grace stepped slightly closer. Close enough that I could count her eyelashes if I wanted to. Close enough that if I reached out, I could touch her face.

I was frozen. Wanting to close that last distance and terrified of doing it. Wanting to know what would happen if I did and knowing it would change everything.

Her lips parted like she was about to say something important. Something that would cross a line we'd been dancing around for weeks.

"Grace! Tommy!" Mrs. Kowalski's voice called from the back door. "Can you come help with something?"

The spell broke.

Grace stepped back quickly, smoothing her dress like that would smooth away whatever had just almost happened. I shoved my hands in my pockets to keep from reaching for her.

"We should go," Grace said, her voice not quite steady.

"Yeah."

We walked toward the building, careful not to touch, careful not to look at each other too long. But my heart was slamming against my ribs, and I could see Grace's hands shaking slightly as she tucked hair behind her ear.

That almost-moment played over and over in my head for the rest of the afternoon. The way she'd looked at me. How close we'd been standing. What she'd been about to say before Mrs. Kowalski interrupted.

And how desperately I'd wanted her to say it anyway.

I was in too deep. Way too deep. The careful distance I'd tried to maintain was completely gone. I'd let Grace in—let her see parts of me I'd never shown anyone, let myself care about her more than was smart or safe or reasonable.

And the terrifying truth was I couldn't make myself regret it.

Even knowing how impossible this was. Even knowing she lived on the right side of the tracks and I lived on the wrong one. Even knowing that wanting her could only lead to disappointment and hurt.

I couldn't make myself stay away.

Not anymore.

Maybe not ever again.
