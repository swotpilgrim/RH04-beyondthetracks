# Chapter 14: Small Touches

After the almost-kiss, everything changed and nothing changed.

We didn't talk about it. Didn't acknowledge what had happened or almost happened. On the surface, we went back to normal—Grace teaching her reading groups, me fixing things, both of us watching over the kids.

But underneath, every interaction hummed with awareness.

The smallest touches became significant.

Tuesday afternoon, I was replacing warped boards on the back fence. Grace came outside to check on the kids playing basketball. She walked over to where I was working.

"How's it going?" she asked.

"Almost done."

"That's good. Mrs. Kowalski will be happy."

I nodded, focusing on the board I was securing.

"Tommy, I wanted to say—"

I looked up. She was gesturing while talking, and her hand landed on my arm. Just rested there naturally, like it belonged.

We both froze.

Her hand on my bare forearm. Skin on skin. The touch burned in the best way.

Grace pulled her hand back like she'd been shocked. "Sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine."

But it wasn't fine. My arm still felt warm where she'd touched it. I could see the flush rising in her cheeks.

"I should let you work," she said quickly.

She walked away, but I watched her go. Noticed that she touched her hand to her chest, right over her heart, like she was feeling the same thing I was.

A simple touch. Accidental. Meaningless to anyone watching.

But loaded with everything we weren't saying.

Thursday, Grace was carrying a stack of new books Mrs. Kowalski had gotten from a donation. The floor was uneven—had been for years—and Grace's heel caught in a crack.

She stumbled.

I caught her without thinking. Hands on her waist, steadying her. She grabbed my shoulders for balance.

For a second, we were pressed close together. Her face inches from mine. Both of us breathing hard from the scare.

"You okay?" My voice came out rough.

"Yes. Thank you."

Neither of us let go immediately.

Her hands were warm on my shoulders. Mine spanned her waist—I could feel how small she was under my palms, how perfectly she seemed to fit against me.

"The floor's uneven," I said stupidly.

"I'll be more careful."

"I could fix it. The floor."

"That would be good."

We were still holding each other. Still standing too close. Still not moving apart.

"Grace—"

She stepped back. I dropped my hands. The books she'd been carrying were scattered on the floor. We both crouched to pick them up, careful not to touch again.

But my hands were shaking.

Saturday, the back fence needed painting. I'd finished the repairs earlier in the week, now it needed protection from weather. I showed up with paint and brushes, ready to work alone.

Grace appeared in the doorway.

"Need help?"

"You don't have to—"

"I want to."

So we painted together. Side by side in the August heat, spreading white paint over weathered wood.

We worked mostly in silence, but it was comfortable. Every so often, we'd reach for the same paint can or brush. Our hands would come close, almost touching, then veer away at the last second.

Grace pushed her hair off her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a small streak of white paint. I noticed the curve of her neck where her hair was pulled up. The small gold cross she always wore catching the light. The way sweat made her skin glow.

I was staring. I knew I was staring.

She turned and caught me looking.

Held my gaze instead of looking away.

The moment stretched between us. Her with paint on her forehead and her hands, me with my heart doing complicated things in my chest.

"You have paint," I said, gesturing vaguely to my own forehead.

"Oh." She wiped at it, smearing it worse. "Did I get it?"

"Here." I reached up without thinking, used my thumb to wipe the paint from her skin.

The touch was gentle. Intimate. My thumb against her temple, her eyes locked on mine.

"There," I said quietly.

"Thank you."

I dropped my hand but didn't step back. Neither did she.

We stood there in the heat, paint brushes forgotten, just looking at each other.

"Tommy—"

"Grace, I—"

We both spoke at once. Both stopped. Both smiled nervously.

"You first," I said.

"No, you."

"I was just going to say you're good at this. Painting."

"Oh." She looked disappointed. Like she'd hoped I'd say something else. "Thanks. You too."

We turned back to the fence. Kept painting.

But the air between us stayed charged.

Monday afternoon, Mrs. Kowalski asked me to run to the hardware store for supplies. Grace volunteered to come help carry things back.

We walked the four blocks together. Copper Ridge was small enough that everything was walkable, but most people from Grace's side of town drove everywhere. She didn't seem to mind walking, though.

Our shoulders brushed as we walked. Not constantly, but regularly. With each brush of contact, I felt it all the way through me.

We fell into step naturally. Same pace, same rhythm. Like we'd been walking together for years instead of weeks.

"I've been reading more Dickinson," Grace said.

"Yeah?"

"'Hope is the thing with feathers.' Do you know it?"

"Little bit."

"I've been thinking about it. How she says hope perches in the soul and sings without words. How it never asks for anything in return."

"Sounds like Dickinson."

"It made me think about us. About this."

I glanced at her. "This?"

"Being able to talk. To be real with each other. It feels like hope, doesn't it? Like maybe there's something worth singing about."

My throat felt tight. "Yeah. It does."

Our hands swung as we walked. Close enough that our knuckles brushed occasionally.

Each brush felt intentional even when it couldn't have been.

At the hardware store, I bought what Mrs. Kowalski needed. Grace insisted on carrying half the supplies back. I gave her the lighter bag, kept the heavier one myself.

Walking back, we talked about poetry and the kids and nothing in particular. Surface conversation masking the undercurrent of everything we felt but couldn't say.

When we got back to the center, we both reached for the door handle at the same time.

Our hands collided.

Fingers tangling together on the metal handle.

We both froze.

I should pull my hand away. Open the door. Go inside. Return to the safety of distance and pretending.

Instead, I let my fingers curl around hers. Just for a second. Just to know what it felt like to hold her hand, even in this stolen accidental way.

Grace's breath caught. She looked up at me with wide eyes, lips slightly parted.

We stood there on the back steps of the community center, hands intertwined on a door handle, the world narrowed to the space between us.

"Tommy," she whispered.

I heard footsteps inside. Someone approaching the door.

We sprang apart just as the door swung open. Mrs. Kowalski stood there, smiling cheerfully.

"Oh good, you're back! Did they have the hinges I needed?"

"Yes, ma'am." My voice sounded normal somehow, despite my racing heart. "Got everything on your list."

"Wonderful! Bring them inside."

We followed her in, careful not to look at each other, careful not to touch again.

But my hand still tingled where her fingers had been.

The week progressed like that. Small moments that meant everything. Touches that seemed accidental but lingered just a heartbeat too long. Looks that said things we couldn't voice.

We were courting in secret. Hidden in plain sight where nobody thought to look.

Because who would suspect? Pastor Mitchell's perfect daughter and Tommy Keane from the wrong side of the tracks? The idea was ridiculous. Impossible.

Which made it feel precious. Like a secret treasure we'd found and were protecting from a world that would take it away.

Wednesday, we were both in the main room. Grace helping kids with homework, me fixing a wobbly table leg. We kept gravitating toward each other. She'd finish with one kid, stand up, end up near where I was working. I'd need a different tool, walk past her table, catch her eye.

We weren't planning it. But we were doing it.

Like magnets pulling toward each other.

Thursday afternoon, almost quitting time. Most kids had already gone home. Grace was organizing her books, I was putting away tools.

We ended up at the supply closet at the same time.

"Sorry," she said. "You go first."

"No, you."

We both smiled at the familiar dance.

Then we were both reaching into the closet. My shoulder pressed against hers. Our arms touched from shoulder to elbow.

Neither of us moved away.

We stood there, pressed together in that small space, pretending to look for supplies neither of us actually needed.

"Grace," I said quietly.

"I know."

"This is—"

"I know."

"We should—"

"I know that too."

But neither of us moved.

"I think about you all the time," she whispered. "Even when I'm not here. Even when I should be thinking about other things."

"Me too."

"Is that wrong?"

"Probably."

"But it doesn't feel wrong."

"No. It doesn't."

We turned to face each other in that small space. Close enough to kiss. Close enough for everything to change.

"Tommy, I—"

"Grace! Time to go!" her father's voice called from outside. He'd come to pick her up.

The spell broke. Reality crashed back.

"I have to go," she said.

"I know."

She hesitated, like she wanted to say more. Then she was gone, gathering her things, calling goodbye to Mrs. Kowalski.

I stayed in the supply closet, breathing hard, my whole body still humming from her proximity.

This was dangerous. What we were doing, how we were feeling, the lines we were dancing around without quite crossing.

But I couldn't stop. Couldn't pull back. Couldn't protect myself from the inevitable hurt that had to be coming.

Because every touch, every look, every stolen moment with Grace felt like proof that maybe—impossibly, improbably—this wasn't just me falling alone.

She was falling too.

And that changed everything.
