# Chapter 13: Both Trapped

The heat wave returned with a vengeance in mid-August. The center became an oven by afternoon, the old brick building holding heat like it had a grudge. Mrs. Kowalski gave up trying to keep the kids inside—better to let them play in the shade than suffocate indoors.

Grace and I stood under the covered area near the back door, watching Danny and a group of kids throw a worn football in the patch of shade from the oak tree. Even in the shade, the heat was oppressive. Grace had pulled her hair up, and I'd rolled my sleeves to my elbows. Didn't help much.

"I don't know how you do it," Grace said. "Working in this at the rail yard."

"You get used to it. Doesn't mean you like it."

She fanned herself with her hand. "I feel like I can't breathe."

"Heat makes everything harder."

We stood there in companionable silence for a minute, watching the kids. Danny threw a wild pass that one of the younger boys missed. They argued good-naturedly about whose fault it was.

"We keep having the same conversation," Grace said suddenly.

"What conversation?"

"About being trapped. We keep circling back to it."

I leaned against the doorframe. "Because we are."

"But differently."

"Yeah. Differently."

Grace turned to look at me. Sweat beaded on her forehead, and her cheeks were flushed from the heat. She looked real, human, nothing like the untouchable perfect girl I'd thought she was months ago.

"You have more freedom than I do," she said.

"What?"

"Freedom. You can make your own choices. Nobody dictates your every move or judges every decision. You work where you want, spend your free time how you choose. I don't have that."

I stared at her. "Grace, I work where I work because it's the only option. I'm here because I can't afford to be anywhere else."

"But you chose to work here, at the center. Nobody forced you."

"You chose to volunteer here."

"After months of asking my father for permission. After promising it wouldn't interfere with church obligations. After agreeing to strict conditions about when I could come and how long I could stay."

I hadn't known that. "He put conditions on you volunteering?"

"Of course he did. Everything has conditions. If I want to do anything outside of what's expected, I have to negotiate for it. And even then, people watch. Question. Judge."

"But you have resources I don't. Education. Respect. A future with actual possibilities."

"Possibilities that aren't mine to choose."

"That's different from having no possibilities at all."

Grace's eyes flashed. "Is it? At least you can dream about leaving, even if it's hard. You can imagine a different life. I'm not even allowed to want something different from what's been decided for me."

"You think I can leave? Grace, I'm eighteen with no diploma, no money, no connections. I'm as trapped by what I don't have as you are by what you do."

"But theoretically you could—"

"Theoretically means nothing when you're loading freight cars to help your mother pay rent. When your father tells you you'll never be more than he was. When the world looks at you and sees exactly one thing—rough kid from the wrong neighborhood with no future."

We were both getting heated, voices rising slightly. The kids glanced over, curious, but kept playing.

"At least people don't expect you to be perfect," Grace said.

"At least people expect something from you at all. I could disappear tomorrow and most people would just nod and say 'yeah, that tracks. Keane kid going nowhere.'"

"I wish I could disappear."

"You don't mean that."

"Don't I? Don't you ever wish you could just... not exist? Not have to carry the weight of everyone's assumptions about who you should be?"

The rawness in her voice stopped me. We stood there staring at each other, both breathing hard from more than just the heat.

"We're arguing about whose prison is worse," I said finally.

Grace blinked. "What?"

"That's what we're doing. Arguing about whose cage is more restrictive. But that's not the point."

"Then what is the point?"

"That we're both in cages. Different kinds, different bars. But both trapped."

The fight drained out of her posture. "Yes. You're right."

"You've got comfort without freedom. I've got theoretical freedom without resources or respect to use it. Different cells, same captivity."

"Both kept small by other people's expectations."

"Yours too high, mine too low."

Grace leaned against the opposite side of the doorway, mirroring my position. We faced each other across the few feet of covered space.

"I hate it," she said quietly. "I hate feeling like this is all there is. Like I'm already living my whole life at seventeen and it's just going to be more of the same forever."

"I know what you mean."

"Do you ever feel like you're suffocating? Like there's not enough air in your whole life?"

"All the time."

We looked at each other, really looked. Two people from completely different worlds who somehow understood the same loneliness, the same trapped feeling, the same desperate want for something more.

"Talking to you is the only time I don't feel like I'm drowning," Grace said.

The confession hit me in the chest. "Grace—"

"I mean it. When I'm with you, I can breathe. I can say what I actually think instead of what I'm supposed to think. I can be messy and uncertain and real."

"You make me feel like maybe I'm more than everyone says I am," I admitted. "Like maybe there's something in me worth seeing."

"There is. So much."

"You make me believe I could be different. Could do more. Could be more."

"You already are more, Tommy. You just don't see it yet."

The heat shimmered around us. The kids' voices faded into background noise. Everything narrowed to Grace standing across from me, eyes locked on mine, saying things we'd been dancing around for weeks.

"This whole summer," Grace said softly, "coming here, talking to you—it's the first time I've felt like myself. Like maybe I don't have to be the perfect pastor's daughter forever. Like maybe there's a version of me that's just... me."

"You do that for me too. Make me think maybe I don't have to accept being Tommy Keane, railroad worker, nothing special. Maybe I contain multitudes after all."

A small smile crossed her face at the Whitman reference. "Yes. Exactly that."

We were both quiet for a moment. The air between us felt thick, charged with more than just August heat.

"I see you," I said. "Really see you. Not the perfect daughter everyone expects. The real you underneath."

"I see you too. Not the rough kid with no prospects. The person you actually are."

The distance between us felt suddenly unbearable. We'd been standing maybe four feet apart. It felt like miles and inches at the same time.

Neither of us moved, but something shifted. The air got heavier.

Grace's eyes dropped to my mouth, then back up to my eyes. My heart slammed against my ribs.

This was it. The moment we'd been circling for weeks. The edge we'd been standing on, getting closer and closer without quite stepping off.

I could cross that distance. Four feet, maybe five steps. Could close the space between us and—

Grace leaned forward slightly. Not much, just an inch. But enough that I knew she was thinking the same thing I was. Enough that I could see her pulse jumping in her throat. Enough that I could hear the slight catch in her breathing.

I pushed off from the doorframe. Took half a step toward her.

She didn't move back.

We were maybe two feet apart now. Close enough that I could smell the flower scent despite the heat. Close enough to see the gold flecks in her brown eyes. Close enough that if I reached out, I could—

"Tommy! Grace!" Danny's voice cut through the moment like a knife. "The Carter twins are fighting!"

We both froze. Then sprang apart like we'd been caught doing something wrong instead of just standing near each other.

The kids were gathered around the twins, who were shoving each other over some dispute about the football game. Mrs. Kowalski hadn't heard the commotion yet, but she would soon if we didn't intervene.

"I'll handle it," I said, voice rougher than normal.

I walked over to the kids, put myself between the twins, sorted out the argument with half my brain while the other half stayed focused on what had just almost happened.

We'd almost kissed. Or almost almost kissed. We'd been seconds from crossing a line we couldn't uncross.

I got the twins settled, got the game restarted peacefully, then risked a glance back at the covered area.

Grace was gone. Probably went inside to help Mrs. Kowalski with something. Probably needed space as much as I did.

My hands were shaking slightly. Adrenaline from what almost happened, from how close we'd come.

For weeks, we'd been getting closer. Sharing secrets, understanding each other, seeing past the cages other people put us in. But until this moment, we'd kept it somewhat contained. Kept it in the realm of deep friendship, meaningful connection.

That moment just now had almost made it something else entirely.

And the terrifying part was I'd wanted it to. Had wanted to close that distance, break down that last barrier, stop pretending this was just two people understanding each other.

Because it wasn't just that anymore. Maybe it never had been.

I was falling in love with Grace Mitchell. Was probably already in love with her.

And from the way she'd looked at me, the way she'd leaned toward me instead of away, the way her breath had caught—

She felt it too.

We were both trapped in our different cages. But we'd found each other through the bars. And what we'd found wasn't just understanding or friendship or even attraction.

It was something deeper. Something that made the cages feel less solid. Something that made us both believe, however impossibly, that maybe there was a way out.

Together.

The thought terrified and exhilarated me in equal measure.
