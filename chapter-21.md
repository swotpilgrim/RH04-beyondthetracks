# Chapter 21: Grace Torn

September arrived with cooler mornings and fall colors. School started, including for Grace. I knew because Marty's girlfriend mentioned it. Couldn't escape information about Grace Mitchell even when I tried.

And I was trying. God knows I was trying.

But small towns don't let you escape anything.

The first I heard about Grace's unhappiness came from my mother. She'd been at the grocer's Thursday, came home with more than vegetables.

"Saw some church ladies today," Ma said, putting away canned goods. "Talking about the Mitchell family."

I focused on the newspaper I wasn't reading. "Yeah?"

"Grace hasn't been herself since she stopped volunteering. Mrs. Walsh says the girl looks peaked. Not eating right."

My hands tightened on the newspaper. "She'll be fine."

"Maybe. But Mrs. Henderson saw Grace at the church picnic last weekend. Said the poor thing barely smiled. Stood with her mother the whole time."

"Why are you telling me this?"

Ma looked at me with eyes that saw everything. "No reason. Just conversation."

But it wasn't no reason. Ma knew. Maybe not the whole story, but enough. She'd seen me come home with a black eye. Seen me stop going to the center. Seen me work myself to exhaustion.

She knew. And now she was telling me Grace was suffering too.

I saw Grace twice that week, both times from a distance.

First was Sunday after church. I'd parked at the far end of the lot and was heading back when I saw her.

She stood near the church steps with her mother, wearing a yellow dress that looked wrong. Too bright. Like someone had painted sunshine over gray skies.

Even from fifty yards away, I could see she'd lost weight. Her face looked thinner, pale. She stood very straight, very proper, but there was no spark.

She looked hollow.

I made myself walk to my truck. Made myself not go to her.

She'd chosen obedience over me. I had no right to her anymore.

My hand was on the truck door when I glanced back. Grace had turned, was looking across the parking lot. Looking at me.

Our eyes met. Held.

Neither of us smiled. Just looked at each other across the distance that had always been there.

Then her mother touched her arm, and Grace turned away.

I drove home, Grace's pale face following me the whole way.

The second time was worse.

Wednesday evening, driving home from an extra shift, I took a different route. The route past the Mitchell house.

Grace was on the front porch.

She sat on the porch swing, barely moving it. A book lay closed in her lap. She wasn't reading, just staring at nothing. The evening light made her look ghostly.

Alone.

Even surrounded by family, she looked utterly alone.

The way I felt alone.

We were both alone now. Separately. The way we were supposed to be.

I kept driving. Forced myself not to turn around, not to ask what I was dying to know.

Did she think about me? Did she regret her choice?

I'd never know. Couldn't ask.

Friday afternoon, Mrs. Kowalski showed up at the rail yard.

I was on my lunch break, eating a sandwich that tasted like sawdust, when I saw her ancient Buick pull up at the edge of the lot. She got out slowly—she had arthritis that made her movements careful—and headed straight for me.

"Mrs. Kowalski." I stood, brushing crumbs from my work pants. "Is everything okay? The kids—"

"Kids are fine. Center's fine. Well, fine as we can be without proper help." She gave me a pointed look. "But that's not why I'm here."

"Okay."

"Sarah Mitchell came to see me Tuesday afternoon."

My heart kicked. "Grace's mother?"

"The same. She wanted to talk about you." Mrs. Kowalski settled onto the bench next to where I'd been sitting, gesturing for me to join her. "Asked me what kind of person you really were. Said she'd heard a lot of different things and wanted the truth."

I sat slowly. "What did you tell her?"

"The truth. That you're reliable, kind under that rough exterior, good with the kids. That you worked hard and asked for nothing in return. That you have a temper when it comes to protecting people, but your heart's in the right place." She looked at me directly. "That the fight with Eddie Russo happened because you were protecting young Danny from getting recruited into that crowd."

"She say anything else?"

"Not much. Listened thoughtfully. Didn't argue or defend her husband, but didn't criticize him either. Just thanked me for my honesty and left." Mrs. Kowalski patted my hand. "But I got the impression she was trying to understand something. Make up her own mind about something."

"About whether I'm good enough for her daughter."

"Maybe. Or about whether her husband's fear is justified, or if it's just prejudice wearing a father's protective face." She stood, knees creaking. "Either way, she was asking. That means something."

"Means what? That I should get my hopes up again? Let myself believe—" I stopped, shook my head. "It doesn't matter what Mrs. Mitchell thinks. Pastor Mitchell made his decision. Grace made hers by obeying him. It's over."

"Is it?" Mrs. Kowalski studied me. "Because from where I'm standing, two young people are miserable apart. That doesn't seem over. That seems paused."

"Same thing."

"Not even close." She started back toward her car, then paused. "Revival meeting's this Sunday at Riverside Park. You going?"

"I don't—why?"

"Just wondering. Seems like the kind of thing the whole town attends. All kinds of people from all kinds of neighborhoods." She smiled slightly. "You never know what might happen when a whole community comes together."

She left before I could respond, her Buick rattling away in a cloud of exhaust.

I sat there turning over her words. Sarah Mitchell had asked about me. Had sought out Mrs. Kowalski for the truth, not just relying on gossip and her husband's fears.

That meant something. Didn't it?

Or was I grasping at straws, looking for hope where there wasn't any?

That night at dinner, my mother mentioned the revival meeting.

"It's Sunday afternoon at Riverside Park," she said, passing potatoes. "The whole church is going. Pastor Mitchell's leading the service."

"We're not really church people," I pointed out.

"We go sometimes. And this is a community event. The Johnsons are going, the Hendersons. Even folks from our neighborhood." She looked at me. "It would be good to show our faces. Let people see us being part of the community."

"You mean let people see we're respectable despite living on the wrong side of the tracks."

"Tommy." Ma's voice was sharp. "I mean it would be good to participate. Is that so wrong?"

Frank looked up from his plate. "Boy doesn't want to go to church, don't make him go to church."

"It's not church, it's a community gathering—"

"Leave him be, Helen."

They argued about it through dinner. I didn't participate, just pushed food around my plate and thought about Sunday afternoon at Riverside Park. Pastor Mitchell leading the service. The whole town attending.

Including Grace.

She'd be there in the front section with her family. I'd see her from whatever distance I could manage. Maybe our eyes would meet again across that space that seemed to grow wider every day.

Maybe they wouldn't.

Maybe I should skip it entirely, avoid the torture of seeing her and not being able to talk to her, not being able to say any of the things that kept me awake at night.

But even as I thought it, I knew I'd go.

Because masochist that I was, I'd take any chance to see her, even from a distance. Even if it hurt. Even if it changed nothing.

That night, lying in bed, I let myself think about what I'd been avoiding.

Did Grace think about me? When she sat on that porch swing staring at nothing, was she remembering our conversations? The storage room, the poetry, the possibility?

Did she lie awake like I did, remembering?

Or was I just a summer mistake she was learning to forget?

I wanted to believe the first. Feared the second.

The not knowing was its own torture. Worse than certainty, maybe. Because not knowing left room for hope. And hope was dangerous.

Hope hurt.

I told myself to stop hoping. Stop wondering.

But I couldn't.

Couldn't stop thinking about Grace's pale face and hollow eyes. Couldn't stop wondering if she missed me the way I missed her.

Couldn't stop hoping that maybe, somehow, this wasn't over.

Even though I knew it probably was.

I hoped anyway.

Because I was a fool.

And fools hope for impossible things.

Like railroad tracks that didn't divide towns.

Like fathers who changed their minds.

Like girls from the right side of town who might still care about boys from the wrong side.

Sunday was coming. The revival meeting.

I'd go. I'd see Grace from whatever distance I could manage.

And maybe I'd get some answer to the questions keeping me awake.

Or maybe I'd just torture myself for nothing.

Either way, I couldn't stay away.

Because somewhere in this town, Grace Mitchell sat on her porch looking hollow and alone, and I needed to know if she felt even a fraction of what I felt.

Even if the answer destroyed me.
