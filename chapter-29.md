# Chapter 29: Beyond the Tracks

The walk from my truck to the Mitchell's front door required crossing their lawn, their property line, their threshold.

But before all that, it required crossing the railroad tracks that divided Copper Ridge into two worlds.

I'd crossed those tracks a thousand times. Driven over them, walked across them, worked beside them my entire life. They were as familiar as my own reflection.

But this time felt different. This time, Grace's hand was in mine. This time, we were crossing together, deliberately, symbolically claiming that the division they represented didn't have to divide us.

"You're nervous," Grace observed as we walked.

"Terrified," I admitted. "Your father has every reason to say no. Every reason to tell you I'm not good enough."

"He might." Grace squeezed my hand. "But I'm not asking his permission. I'm asking for his understanding. There's a difference."

The Mitchell house sat on a tree-lined street where every lawn was manicured, every house freshly painted. The kind of neighborhood where railroad workers only came to fix things and left quickly afterward.

My truck looked out of place parked at the curb.

I felt out of place walking up the path.

But Grace's hand in mine felt right, so I kept walking.

Pastor Mitchell answered our knock. He looked at our joined hands for a long moment, and a dozen emotions crossed his face—resignation, concern, something that might have been reluctant acceptance.

"Grace," he said. Then, with visible effort, "Tommy."

"Dad." Grace's voice was steady despite the slight tremor I felt in her hand. "We'd like to talk to you. If you have time."

"I think we'd better." He stepped back, gesturing us inside. "Your mother's in the parlor."

The house was everything mine wasn't—spacious, well-furnished, smelling of fresh flowers and furniture polish instead of cigarettes and fried food. I tried not to let the contrast make me feel smaller.

Sarah Mitchell sat in the parlor, embroidery in her lap. She looked up when we entered, saw our joined hands, and something soft crossed her face.

"Mrs. Mitchell," I said, nodding respectfully.

"Tommy. Grace." She set aside her embroidery. "Sit, please."

Grace and I sat on the sofa together. I wanted to let go of her hand—it seemed disrespectful to hold it in front of her parents—but Grace kept her grip firm. United front.

Pastor Mitchell settled into his chair, studying us. The silence stretched uncomfortably.

"I'll start," I said finally, because waiting would only make this harder. "Sir, I understand your concerns about me. About Grace and me. I want you to know I understand them completely."

Pastor Mitchell's eyebrows rose slightly, but he didn't interrupt.

"I'm not what any father would want for his daughter. I'm from the wrong neighborhood with a rough reputation. I've got limited prospects—I load freight cars for a living, and that's not likely to change anytime soon. I got into a public fight that frightened Grace and confirmed every bad thing you'd heard about me."

I took a breath, forced myself to keep meeting his eyes.

"I can't promise you I'll give Grace a comfortable life. Can't promise status or security or any of the things you want for her. I can't even promise I'll always make the right choices, because I'm eighteen and still figuring things out."

"Then what can you promise?" Pastor Mitchell's voice was controlled but hard.

"That I care about her more than anything. That I respect her intelligence and her courage and her right to make her own choices. That I'll try every day to be worthy of the faith she's placed in me." I glanced at Grace, then back to her father. "I won't pretend to be perfect, because I'm not. But I'll try to be good. To be better. To build something worth having."

"By loading freight?" There was skepticism in his tone.

"By finishing high school equivalency through night classes. By keeping my job at the center, helping kids who need it. By reading, thinking, growing." I straightened my shoulders. "By not accepting the limitations everyone's put on me. By trying to be more than what people expect."

Pastor Mitchell was quiet for a long moment.

"You got into a fight in front of children. In front of my wife and church committee."

"I did. I was protecting a twelve-year-old boy from being recruited into a gang." I didn't make excuses. "I should have found another way. Should have called the police, gotten help. But I saw Eddie targeting Danny and I reacted. It was the wrong choice, even if my intentions were right."

"How do I know you won't make that choice again? That you won't bring violence and trouble into my daughter's life?"

"You don't know." I met his gaze steadily. "I don't know either. But I know I'll try to do better. Try to think before I act. Try to find smarter solutions than my fists."

"Try isn't certainty."

"No sir, it's not. But it's honest." I leaned forward slightly. "I could stand here and promise I'll never make mistakes, never disappoint you, never be anything but perfect. But that would be a lie. I'll make mistakes. I'll disappoint you sometimes. I'm human and flawed and from circumstances that didn't teach me everything I need to know."

I glanced at Sarah, who was watching with an unreadable expression, then back to Pastor Mitchell.

"But I'll try. I'll keep trying. And I'll love your daughter with everything I have while I'm doing it."

Grace's hand tightened in mine.

Pastor Mitchell looked at his daughter. "Grace? You're being awfully quiet."

"I'm letting Tommy speak for himself." Grace's voice was calm. "But since you asked—I love you, Dad. I respect you. You've been a good father and I'm grateful for everything you've given me."

"But?"

"But I won't let your fears control my life anymore." Grace sat straighter. "You're afraid Tommy will hurt me. Afraid he'll bring me down or damage my reputation or prove to be everything you've worried about. And maybe he will. Maybe this won't work out. Maybe I'll get hurt."

Pastor Mitchell's face tightened.

"But I'd rather risk being hurt while being real than be safe while pretending to be someone I'm not." Grace looked at me, then back to her father. "Tommy sees me. Not the pastor's daughter, not the perfect example for youth group. Me. The person I actually am, with doubts and questions and a desire for authentic connection."

"Grace—"

"I'm not choosing him to rebel against you. I'm choosing him because he values who I really am. Because he challenges me to be honest and brave and real." Her voice strengthened. "Because when I'm with him, I feel like myself for the first time in years."

Sarah Mitchell reached over and touched her husband's hand gently.

Pastor Mitchell looked at Tommy, then at Grace, then down at his wife's hand on his.

The silence stretched long enough to become painful.

"What do you want from life, Tommy?" Pastor Mitchell asked finally.

The question surprised me. "Sir?"

"You're eighteen. What do you want from life? What are your goals, your ambitions, your plans?"

I could have lied. Could have invented respectable ambitions about business or college or climbing some social ladder.

Instead, I told the truth.

"I'm figuring it out," I admitted. "I know helping those kids at the center matters to me. Giving them someone to look up to, showing them there's more than what they've been told. That matters."

Pastor Mitchell nodded slightly.

"I know poetry matters. Reading, thinking, trying to understand the world beyond Copper Ridge. That matters too." I took a breath. "And Grace matters. Being worthy of her, being someone she's proud to know. That might matter most of all."

"Those aren't plans. Those are feelings."

"They're starting points, sir. Starting points for building something. I don't have all the answers yet. But I know where I want to begin."

Pastor Mitchell studied me for what felt like an eternity. I made myself hold his gaze, even though every instinct said to look away from the judgment I saw there.

"I can't approve of this," he said finally.

My stomach dropped.

"Dad—" Grace started, but he held up a hand.

"I can't approve because you're too young, both of you. Because Tommy's circumstances aren't what I want for you, Grace. Because there are too many obstacles and too much potential for hurt." He looked at his daughter. "But I also can't forbid it. Not after your speech at the revival. Not after seeing how miserable you've been."

He turned back to me, and his expression was stern.

"I won't forbid the relationship. But Tommy, you'd better prove yourself worthy of my daughter's faith in you. You'd better work harder than you've ever worked. Be better than anyone expects. Show me—show her—that this trust she's placing in you isn't misplaced."

"I will, sir. I'll try my hardest."

"Try isn't enough. Do." Pastor Mitchell stood, and I stood with him. "Do you understand me?"

"Yes sir."

He extended his hand. I took it, and we shook—his grip firm, testing, sizing me up with that handshake the way men do.

It wasn't warm. Wasn't welcoming. But it was acknowledgment.

I'd take it.

Grace was crying, but she was smiling too. Sarah Mitchell's eyes were wet as well.

"Thank you," Grace said to her father. "For listening. For trying."

"I love you," Pastor Mitchell said gruffly. "That doesn't mean I'm happy about this. But I love you enough to let you make your own choices. Even when I think you're choosing wrong."

"I'm not choosing wrong." Grace stood, went to hug her father. "You'll see."

We left a few minutes later, walking back through their perfect neighborhood to my beat-up truck. Grace was still holding my hand.

"That went better than I expected," I said.

"He didn't forbid it. That's huge." Grace looked up at me. "It's not approval, but it's permission to try. That's all we need."

I helped her into the truck, then walked around to my side. Before I got in, I looked back at the Mitchell house—so different from mine, so far above my circumstances.

But Grace had chosen to cross those tracks with me anyway.

And her father had chosen to let her.

It wasn't a fairy tale. Wasn't happily ever after tied up with a bow.

But it was a beginning.

And sometimes, a beginning was enough.
