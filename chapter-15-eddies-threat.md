# Chapter 15: Eddie's Threat

Late August afternoon, the heat finally breaking into something almost comfortable. I was outside the center with Danny Porter and a handful of younger kids, shooting basketball on the court I'd fixed earlier in the summer.

"Like this?" Danny asked, trying the hook shot I'd just shown him.

"Almost. Keep your elbow in more. Yeah, like that."

He tried again. The ball bounced off the rim but closer than before.

"Good. You're getting it."

Danny grinned. The kid had come a long way since Grace started working with him. His reading was improving, his confidence growing. He'd started talking about maybe staying in school, maybe even going to high school. Small dreams, maybe, but bigger than anything he'd let himself think before.

I was proud of him. Proud of all these kids who kept showing up, kept trying, kept believing they could be more than everyone expected.

The sound of an engine made me look up.

A beat-up '51 Chevy pulled into the parking lot. I recognized it immediately. My stomach tightened.

Eddie Russo.

The car stopped, and Eddie got out, along with two other guys I knew from the neighborhood. Tommy Ricci and Jake something—I'd never learned his last name. All three of them had that dangerous swagger, that look that said they owned whatever space they occupied.

Eddie was twenty now, a year older than me but looking older. Hard living did that. He wore his hair slicked back, a leather jacket despite the heat, jeans with the cuffs rolled up. A cigarette dangled from his mouth.

He'd been my friend once. We'd run together as kids, gotten in trouble together, had each other's backs. But somewhere around sixteen, our paths had split. I'd started working the rail yard, started coming to the center. Eddie had started working for people you didn't want to work for.

The kids on the basketball court had gone quiet. They all knew who Eddie Russo was. Some of their older brothers ran with his crew. Some had been recruited themselves.

Eddie walked toward us, all easy charm and sharp edges underneath.

"Tommy Keane," he called out, grinning. "Long time."

"Eddie."

His eyes swept over the kids, landing on Danny. "Well, look at you. Little Danny Porter, all grown up. How old are you now, kid?"

"Twelve," Danny said quietly.

"Twelve." Eddie nodded appreciatively. "Getting big. Strong too, I bet."

I moved between them. "What do you want, Eddie?"

"Just being friendly. Can't a guy talk to the neighborhood kids?"

"You're not here to talk."

Eddie's grin widened. "You always could see right through me, Tommy." He turned his attention back to Danny. "You looking to make some real money, Danny? Kid your age, smart like you are, there's opportunities."

My jaw clenched. "Danny, go inside."

Danny looked between me and Eddie, uncertain.

"Just wait a minute, Tommy," Eddie said smoothly. "Let the kid make his own choices. He's not a baby." Back to Danny: "I'm talking real money, not just quarters for sweeping up or whatever. Real work, real pay. What do you say?"

"I said go inside, Danny."

This time Danny heard the command in my voice. He grabbed the basketball and headed for the center's back door. The other kids followed, sensing trouble.

Eddie watched them go, then turned back to me. His smile hardened.

"That wasn't very nice, Tommy."

"Neither is recruiting twelve-year-olds."

"Recruiting? I was just offering opportunities you don't give them here."

"Yeah? What kind of opportunities? Running packages? Being lookout? Getting them started on a road that ends in jail or worse?"

Eddie's eyes went cold. "Better than false hope. You think this place—" he gestured dismissively at the center "—you think this changes anything? These kids are from here, Tommy. Same as us. They got the same future we got."

"They've got chances—"

"Chances at what? Staying in school where teachers look through them? Working dead-end jobs for pennies? Loading freight until their backs give out like your old man's?"

The jab about my father hit hard, but I kept my expression neutral.

"At least it's honest work."

"And what I do isn't?"

"You know it's not."

Eddie stepped closer. We were almost chest to chest now. "You think you're better than me? Better than where you come from?"

"I think I'm trying to be different."

"Same thing." His voice dripped contempt. "You forgot where you came from, Tommy. Forgot who your people are. You think fixing up this dump and playing hero to these kids makes you respectable? Makes you good enough for that pastor's daughter I've seen you with?"

Heat flushed through me. "Leave her out of this."

"Why? Everyone's talking about it. Pastor Mitchell's perfect little girl slumming with Tommy Keane. People wonder what she's really doing over here, spending all that time with you."

"She's teaching kids to read."

"Sure she is." Eddie's grin was nasty. "And you're just the janitor. Nothing going on there at all."

I wanted to hit him. Wanted it so badly my hands curled into fists.

Eddie saw it and laughed. "There's the Tommy I remember. The one who settled things with his fists. What happened to him?"

"He grew up."

"Nah. He got soft." Eddie flicked his cigarette away. "Look, I didn't come here to fight with you. Came to give you a message. Danny Porter—and kids like him—they're wasted here. They need real opportunities. I'm offering them."

"They're not interested."

"That's not your choice to make. You don't own these kids."

"And you don't get to corrupt them."

"Corrupt them?" Eddie laughed harshly. "I'm giving them a way to make real money. To help their families. To be something more than charity cases at some rundown center."

"By making them criminals."

"By giving them respect. Power. A crew that has their backs. What do you give them? Hope?" He said the word like a curse. "Hope doesn't pay rent, Tommy. Hope doesn't feed families."

"Hope's better than what you're selling."

Eddie stared at me for a long moment. Then he shook his head. "You really have forgotten, haven't you? Forgotten what it's like to be hungry. To watch your mother work herself to death. To have nothing while people on the other side of town have everything."

"I haven't forgotten anything."

"Then you should understand. But you're too busy playing good guy, trying to impress your girl from the right side." He stepped back. "I'll be back, Tommy. And next time, maybe I talk to Danny when you're not around. Kid should hear all his options."

"Stay away from him. From all of them."

"Or what? You'll stop me?" Eddie gestured to his guys. "You're outnumbered, outgunned, and out of your depth. You want to protect these kids? You can't. Not from real life. Not from people like me who actually know how this world works."

Tommy Ricci and Jake moved up behind Eddie, backing his play.

I was outnumbered. Eddie was right about that. But I didn't move.

"I'll do what I have to," I said quietly.

Something flickered in Eddie's expression. Respect, maybe. Or memory of the friendship we used to have.

"You always were stubborn," he said. "It's gonna get you hurt someday."

"Maybe. But not today."

Eddie looked at me for another long moment, then jerked his head at his guys. They headed back to the Chevy.

"See you around, Tommy," Eddie called as he got in the car. "Give my regards to the pastor's daughter."

The engine roared to life. They peeled out of the parking lot, leaving tire marks on the asphalt.

I stood there breathing hard, adrenaline pumping through my system.

The back door opened. Danny poked his head out.

"Is he gone?"

"Yeah. He's gone."

Danny came all the way out. "What did he want?"

"Doesn't matter. You're not interested."

"He said I could make real money."

My heart sank. "Danny—"

"But I'm not stupid." Danny crossed his arms. "I know what kind of money guys like Eddie make. My brother went down that road. He's in prison now."

Relief flooded through me. "Good. That's good that you know."

"I'm staying in school. Like you said. Like Miss Mitchell says." He looked at me seriously. "But he's going to come back, isn't he?"

"Probably."

"What are you going to do?"

I looked at this twelve-year-old kid who reminded me so much of myself at that age. Standing at a crossroads. Choosing which path to take.

"Whatever I have to," I said. "To keep you and the others safe."

Danny nodded, satisfied with that answer. He headed back inside.

I stayed in the parking lot, staring at the tire marks, my mind racing.

Eddie wasn't done. He'd be back, and next time he might not be so civilized about it. He'd target Danny specifically, or one of the other vulnerable kids. He'd make offers they'd find hard to refuse.

And if I tried to stop him physically... well, Eddie wasn't bluffing about being outnumbered and outgunned.

The back door opened again. This time it was Grace.

"I saw from the window," she said quietly. "Who was that?"

"Eddie Russo. Old friend turned bad news."

"What did he want?"

"To recruit Danny for his crew."

Grace's face went hard. "He can't do that. Danny's just a child."

"Eddie doesn't care. He sees potential soldiers, not kids."

"We have to stop him."

The "we" hit me square in the chest. Not "you have to stop him." We.

"I don't know how," I admitted. "If I fight him, I'm just proving I'm the rough kid everyone says I am. If I don't, he gets to Danny and the others."

Grace stepped closer. Close enough that I could smell her flower scent even with the stink of tire rubber in the air.

"Then we figure it out together," she said.

I looked at her—this girl from the right side of town who should have run from guys like Eddie, from problems like this. But she stood there ready to fight for these kids, for this center, for me.

"This could get ugly," I warned.

"I don't care."

"Your father wouldn't—"

"I don't care," she repeated firmly. "These kids matter. This place matters. You matter."

The last part was said quieter, but I heard it clearly.

Around us, summer was starting to wind down. In a few weeks, school would start. The center's programs would shift. Everything would change.

But right now, standing in a parking lot with Grace, facing down a threat from my past, I realized something.

I wasn't alone anymore.

Whatever came next—with Eddie, with the center, with everything—I wasn't facing it alone.

And that made all the difference.
