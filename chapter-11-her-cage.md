# Chapter 11: Her Cage

The first week of August brought a break in the heat. The air felt almost comfortable, and the center buzzed with kids enjoying the reprieve. Grace and I found ourselves in the storage room late afternoon, ostensibly to discuss which books to order for the older reading group.

But we both knew that wasn't really why we were there.

She sat on the paint can, I leaned against the workbench. The door was pulled mostly closed, giving us the illusion of privacy in the busy center. Between us on the bench sat a catalog of children's books, open but forgotten.

"I'm exhausted," Grace said suddenly.

I looked up from the catalog I'd been pretending to study. "Long day?"

"Long summer." She rubbed her temples. "There was another church committee meeting last night. Summer picnic planning. I'm supposed to head the youth group booth at the fair next week. Sunday school planning for fall. My mother's ladies' auxiliary garden party."

"That's a lot."

"It's always a lot." She dropped her hands into her lap. "But I can't say no. Pastor's daughter doesn't say no to church activities."

There was something brittle in her voice. Something I hadn't heard before. Like she was close to breaking.

"You okay?" I asked.

Grace laughed, but it wasn't her real laugh. "I don't know. Am I? I don't even know anymore."

I waited, sensing she needed to say more.

She looked at her hands, twisting them together in her lap. "Do you know what it's like to have everyone watching you all the time? Not just casually—constantly. Scrutinizing everything you do, everything you say, everywhere you go."

"No."

"Every Sunday, I sit in the front pew in my nicest dress with my mother. I smile at everyone. I shake hands. I say appropriate things. The church ladies watch how I dress—is my hem modest enough, is my neckline too low, are my sleeves the right length."

She was speaking faster now, words she'd been holding in spilling out.

"They listen to how I talk—am I setting a good example for the younger girls, am I speaking respectfully, am I representing my father's ministry properly. They watch who I speak to, where I go, what I read. Mrs. Walsh told my mother she saw me buying a magazine at the drugstore and wanted to make sure it was 'appropriate reading for a young Christian woman.'"

I felt anger stirring. "That's none of her business."

"It's all their business. Everything I do reflects on my father and the church. I'm not just Grace—I'm the pastor's daughter. I don't get to be a person. I'm a representation."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It is. I'm tired of smiling when I don't feel like smiling. Tired of saying the right things instead of true things. Tired of being careful every second because someone's always watching, always judging."

She looked up at me, and I saw something raw in her expression. Vulnerable.

"My father means well. He loves me, I know he does. But he sees me as part of his ministry, not as a separate person with my own thoughts and feelings. When he introduces me, it's always 'my daughter Grace' with this tone that says she's a credit to our family. Like I'm an achievement, not a person."

"Grace—"

"I'm not allowed to have doubts. Not allowed to question anything. When I was fourteen, I asked my father about something in a sermon—just a genuine question about theology—and he got upset. Said questioning showed lack of faith. So I stopped asking questions out loud."

She twisted her hands harder.

"I'm not allowed to make mistakes. One time I wore a dress that was slightly shorter than usual—still modest, just newer style—and three different church ladies mentioned it. My mother gently suggested I wear my older dresses to church. I was fifteen."

"That's not right."

"I'm expected to marry someone from a good family. Have children. Support my husband's career. Be involved in church. Raise my children in the faith. My whole future is already mapped out, and nobody's ever asked me if that's what I want."

Her voice cracked slightly.

"The worst part is I don't even know if I don't want it. Maybe I do want that future. But I've never been allowed to want anything different, so how do I know if what I think I want is really what I want or just what I've been told to want?"

She looked at me with eyes that were starting to shine with unshed tears.

"I feel like I'm performing all the time. Being the perfect daughter, the perfect young woman, the perfect example. And underneath the performance, I don't even know who I actually am."

The confession hung in the air between us.

I'd never heard Grace like this—not perfectly composed, not carefully pleasant. Just raw and honest and hurting.

"That sounds really lonely," I said quietly.

Grace's breath hitched. "Yes. That's exactly what it is. Lonely. I'm surrounded by people all the time—church, family, social events. But I feel completely alone because nobody sees me. They see the role I'm playing."

"I see you."

"I know." Her voice was almost a whisper. "That's why this—talking to you—it's the only time I feel real."

Something in my chest tightened painfully.

"You've never told anyone this before?" I asked.

"Who would I tell? My friends from church? They're nice girls, but they wouldn't understand. They think I have the perfect life—perfect family, perfect future. My mother? She's kind, but she's so invested in keeping peace, in everything being proper. She'd just tell me to pray about it and trust my father's wisdom."

"What about other people? Teachers, someone at school?"

Grace shook her head. "Nobody knows what to do with the pastor's daughter who isn't perfectly content. It's easier for everyone if I just play the part."

I understood that feeling more than she knew. Different circumstances, same cage. Her cage was made of high expectations and constant scrutiny. Mine was made of low expectations and being written off. But both of us were trapped.

"Your cage is different from mine," I said, "but it's just as real."

Grace looked at me. "Yes. That's it exactly."

We sat there for a moment, the late afternoon sun coming through the high window casting long shadows across the storage room. The sounds of kids playing filtered through the door, but they felt distant. Like we were in our own small world.

I watched Grace twist her hands in her lap—a nervous gesture I'd seen her do before but never understood until now. Every movement she made in public was probably calculated, careful. But here, in this dusty storage room, she let herself be anxious.

"I'm tired of being perfect," she said quietly. "I'm tired of never being allowed to be messy or uncertain or just... human."

"You're allowed," I said. "Maybe not out there. But here, you're allowed."

She looked up at me. "Here?"

"With me. You don't have to be perfect. You can be real."

Something shifted in her expression. Relief, maybe. Or gratitude. Or something deeper I didn't want to name.

"Thank you," she said. "For listening. For not trying to fix it or tell me I'm being ungrateful or that I should just pray more."

"I can't fix it. And you're not being ungrateful. You're just being honest."

"Honesty is not encouraged in my world."

"Maybe your world is wrong."

A small, sad smile crossed her face. "Maybe. But it's still the world I live in."

"For now."

"What do you mean?"

"You're seventeen. In a year, you could go to college. Leave Copper Ridge. Be somewhere people don't know you as the pastor's daughter."

"My father expects me to attend the women's college nearby. Stay close to home. Help with church youth programs."

"But you don't have to."

"Don't I?"

The question was genuine. Like she really didn't know if she had choices.

"You're not property, Grace. You're a person. You get to decide what you want."

"Easy to say. Harder to do when everyone you love has expectations."

"I know. But still true."

We were sitting closer than I'd realized. The small room seemed to shrink around us. I could see the gold flecks in her brown eyes, the small freckles across her nose that her powder didn't quite cover.

"Coming here has been the first time I've felt free," Grace said softly. "At the center, with the kids, I'm not performing. I'm just... me. Teaching because I want to, talking to you because I enjoy it, not because it's expected or proper."

"The kids love you."

"I love them too. They don't care that I'm the pastor's daughter. They just care that I show up and help them read and listen when they talk."

"You're good at it. At seeing them."

"Maybe because I know what it's like to not be seen."

The parallel between us had never been clearer. Both of us invisible in our own ways—me written off as worthless, her held up as perfect. Neither really seen for who we actually were.

Except when we saw each other.

"Thank you," Grace said again. "For understanding. For not judging. For letting me be honest."

"You don't need to thank me for that."

"Yes, I do. Because it matters. You matter."

The words hung between us, heavy with meaning neither of us was quite ready to name.

From the main room, Mrs. Kowalski called that the kids were starting to leave. The moment broke. Grace stood, smoothing her dress, putting her composed expression back on like armor.

But I'd seen what was underneath now. The girl who felt trapped, lonely, tired of performing. The real Grace, not the perfect pastor's daughter everyone expected.

And she'd trusted me enough to show me.

That trust felt like something precious I needed to protect.

Even if protecting it meant my heart was getting more involved than was safe.
