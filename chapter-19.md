# Chapter 19: Heartbroken But Expected

Part of me had been waiting for this since the first time Grace smiled at me.

That's what I told myself, anyway, in the week after she stopped coming to the center. After her father laid down his law and she obeyed like the good daughter she'd always been. This was always how it would end—pastor's daughter returns to her proper life, railroad worker stays on his side of the tracks. Natural order restored.

I'd been stupid to hope for anything different.

But knowing something's coming doesn't make it hurt less when it arrives. If anything, the anticipation makes it worse. You spend all that time bracing for impact, and when it finally hits, you realize you were never braced enough. Could never be braced enough.

I threw myself into work like a man possessed.

Double shifts became my new normal. I'd show up at the rail yard before dawn, when the sky was still black and the air tasted like diesel and cold metal. Worked until my foreman sent me home, sometimes twelve hours later, sometimes fourteen. Loading freight cars was mindless labor—lift, carry, stack, repeat. The kind of work that exhausted your body so completely you didn't have energy left for thinking.

That was the point.

My hands developed new calluses on top of old ones. My shoulders ached constantly. Bruises bloomed across my ribs from bumping into freight car doors, from hoisting crates that were too heavy for one man. I welcomed the pain. Physical hurt was clean, simple. You knew where it came from and how to treat it. Not like the other kind of pain, the kind that sat in your chest like a stone and wouldn't shift no matter how much you tried to ignore it.

"You trying to kill yourself?" Marty asked one afternoon, watching me load my fifteenth crate without a break. "Because there are easier ways."

"Just working." I hefted another crate, felt something in my back twinge. Ignored it.

"You're working like a man running from something."

"Nothing to run from." I set the crate down, lined it up with the others. Perfect rows. Order from chaos. "Just need the money."

"Bull." Marty handed me a canteen. "This is about the Mitchell girl."

I drank without answering. Water had never tasted so much like nothing.

"Tommy—"

"I don't want to talk about it."

"Maybe you should."

"And say what?" I capped the canteen, shoved it back at him. "That I was an idiot for thinking a girl like that could be with a guy like me? That her father was right to keep her away? That's not news, Marty. Everyone already knew it except me."

"That's not—"

"I need to get back to work." I turned away before he could see my face, before whatever I was holding back could break through. "Foreman wants this car loaded by four."

Marty didn't push after that. Just left me alone with the freight and the ache in my chest that no amount of physical labor could touch.

Evenings were worse. At work, I could lose myself in motion. At home, there was nowhere to hide.

Thursday night I came through the door bone-tired, planning to skip dinner and fall into bed. But Frank was at the kitchen table with a bottle, and he looked up when I walked in.

"You look like hell," he observed.

"Long shift."

"Long week, more like." He poured himself another drink, didn't offer me one. Not that I wanted it. "You been moping around here like somebody died."

"I'm not moping." I grabbed bread from the counter, not hungry but needing something to do with my hands.

"No? What do you call it, then?" Frank's eyes were sharp despite the whiskey. "Let me guess—some girl finally figured out she's too good for you."

My hands froze on the bread loaf. Something hot and dangerous rose in my throat.

"Must've been quite the girl," Frank continued, oblivious or uncaring. "Got you all twisted up. What was she, one of those church girls from the nice neighborhood? Let me tell you something, son—girls like that don't end up with boys like us. The sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be."

"Shut up." The words came out low, controlled. Barely.

"I'm just telling you the truth. You think I didn't have dreams when I was your age? Thought I'd be something more than a broken-down railroad worker?" He laughed, bitter as old coffee. "Life doesn't work that way for our kind. We do the work nobody else wants, break our backs for pennies, and die in the same place we were born. And the nice girls? They marry nice boys from nice families and forget we exist."

My fist connected with the wall before I'd consciously decided to swing. Pain exploded across my knuckles. Plaster cracked. The impact echoed through the small kitchen like a gunshot.

Frank didn't even flinch. Just took another drink.

"See? You got your mother's temper along with my prospects. Wonderful combination."

I pulled my fist back, knuckles already swelling. Stared at the crater I'd put in the wall, breathing hard. Ma would be upset about that. We couldn't afford to fix it.

Couldn't afford to fix anything.

"Go to bed, Tommy." Frank's voice was almost gentle, which somehow made it worse. "Sleep it off. Tomorrow you'll wake up, go to work, come home. Day after that, same thing. That's life. Might as well accept it."

I left before I put another hole in the wall. Before I said something I couldn't take back. Before Frank could see that his words had hit harder than any punch Eddie had landed.

In my room, I lay on my narrow bed and stared at the ceiling. The same ceiling I'd stared at for eighteen years. Water-stained in one corner. Crack running diagonally from the light fixture. I knew every inch of it.

Was this it? Was this all there was? Work and sleep and work again, an endless cycle until my back gave out like my father's?

I thought about Grace despite trying not to. Couldn't help it. Her laugh when the kids at the center said something funny—genuine, unrestrained. How she'd looked at me in the storage room, like I was saying something worth hearing. The way she pushed her hair behind her ear when she was thinking. Her hand brushing mine when she passed me the lemonade, that small touch that had felt enormous.

The poetry. God, the poetry. How her face had lit up when she'd caught me reading Whitman. How we'd talked about words and meaning, and for those moments I'd felt like maybe I was more than a railroad worker with dirt under his nails. Maybe I was someone who noticed things, thought about things, mattered.

With Grace, I'd felt like I mattered.

Without her, I was just Tommy Keane. Wrong side of the tracks. Limited prospects. Exactly what everyone had always said.

I rolled onto my side, pulling the thin blanket higher. Through the wall, I could hear my father's heavy footsteps, glass on wood as he poured another drink. My mother's soft voice. The familiar sounds of a life I'd been born into and would probably die in.

Frank was right. I should accept it. This was my lot—the railroad yard, this house, this side of town. Grace had been a beautiful anomaly, a brief moment when I'd imagined something different. But anomalies don't last.

She was back on her side of the tracks now. Back to her respectable life, probably already forgetting the summer volunteering with poor kids. In a year, she'd be at college. In two, engaged to some nice boy. In five, telling her children about charity work, maybe remembering the center distantly, the way you remember a dream.

And I'd be here. Loading freight cars. Living in this house or one like it. Developing the same bitter edge my father had, the same resignation.

The stone in my chest felt heavier. I pressed my fist against it—the one I'd put through the wall, still throbbing—as if I could physically push the feeling away.

It didn't work.

I'd known this would happen. Had known from the start that Grace was out of my reach, that whatever we'd started couldn't last. Shouldn't last. I'd been waiting for reality to reassert itself.

And now it had.

So why did it feel like dying?

Why did I lie awake until the sky started to lighten, thinking about her smile and her laugh and the way she'd looked at me like I was worth something?

Why couldn't I make myself believe Frank's bitter wisdom—that this was just life, just the way things worked for our kind, and I should accept it and move on?

I couldn't answer those questions. Didn't want to try.

When my alarm went off at five, I dragged myself out of bed, pulled on my work clothes, and headed to the rail yard. Another day of freight cars and diesel fumes. Another day of exhausting myself so I wouldn't think.

Another day of life on my side of the tracks, where I belonged.

Where I'd always belonged.

Grace was gone. That part of my life was over before it had really begun.

I needed to accept it.

I would accept it.

Eventually.

Maybe.

But not yet. Not while I could still remember exactly how she'd looked at me in that storage room, surrounded by poetry and possibility. Not while I could still hear her voice saying my name like it meant something.

Not yet.

So I worked. And I ached. And I told myself tomorrow would be easier.

Knowing it was a lie.

Knowing I'd tell myself the same lie tomorrow, and the day after that.

Until eventually, maybe, it wouldn't be a lie anymore.

Until I forgot how to hope for anything different.

Until I became my father, bitter and broken, warning some future son that nice girls don't end up with boys like us.

The thought should have terrified me.

Instead, it just felt inevitable.

Like everything else in my life. Like Grace leaving. Like me staying.

Like the railroad tracks that divided Copper Ridge into two worlds that were never meant to meet.

I'd crossed those tracks for a little while. Dared to imagine I could belong on the other side.

But gravity always wins. Boys from the wrong side always end up back where they started.

Always.

I should have known better.

I did know better.

I'd just forgotten for a while.

But I remembered now.

And remembering hurt worse than Eddie's punches, worse than my father's words, worse than the ache in my hands from brutal labor.

Remembering hurt like heartbreak.

Which is exactly what it was.
