# Chapter 30: Choosing To Be

The sun was setting when Grace and I walked beyond the railroad tracks to where Copper Ridge met the river.

This spot sat at the border between worlds—past the divided neighborhoods, past the assumptions and judgments, past everything that tried to keep people in their assigned places. Just the river and the September sky and the two of us.

We sat on the grassy bank, shoulders touching, watching the water reflect orange and pink.

"That was intense," Grace said finally.

"Yeah." I was still processing. "Your father didn't forbid it."

"He didn't approve either."

"No. But he gave us permission to try. That's more than I expected." I picked up a stone, turned it over in my palm. "More than I thought I deserved an hour ago."

Grace leaned her head against my shoulder. "What happens now?"

"I don't know." The admission felt freeing somehow. "I've been so focused on just getting here—getting to this moment where we could be together—I haven't thought much past it."

"Me neither." Grace was quiet for a moment. "I know I'm going to teacher's college. My mother reminded me applications are due next month. I want to work with kids like the ones at the center. Kids everyone else writes off."

"You'll be good at that." I meant it. "You've got patience and kindness and you actually see them. That matters."

"What about you? What are your plans?"

I tossed the stone into the river, watched the ripples spread. "I enrolled in night classes. High school equivalency. Mrs. Kowalski helped me figure out the paperwork."

Grace sat up, looking at me with wide eyes. "Tommy, that's wonderful!"

"It's just night classes. Won't make me rich or respectable."

"It's you choosing to grow. That's what matters." She took my hand. "I'm proud of you."

The words did something to my chest—made it tight and warm simultaneously.

"I'll keep working the rail yard during the day. Keep helping at the center when I can. Try to figure out what comes after." I looked at our joined hands. "I can't promise you grand things, Grace. Can't promise I'll be anything more than what I am. But I can promise I'll keep trying."

"That's all I want. Just you trying. Just you being yourself—all of yourself." Grace squeezed my fingers. "We're both young. We don't have to have everything figured out right now."

"No?"

"No. We just have to be honest. Keep choosing each other. Keep being real instead of performing." She leaned against me again. "That's enough for now."

I thought about that. About how revolutionary it felt to just be ourselves. To not pretend or hide or conform to what others expected.

"I've been rereading Whitman," I said. "The poem that started all this. 'Song of Myself.'"

"Quote some for me."

I closed my eyes, pulling the words from memory. "'I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.'"

"Beautiful."

"There's more. 'Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, Healthy, free, the world before me, The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.'" I opened my eyes, looked at Grace. "That's what we're doing, isn't it? Taking the open road. Leading wherever we choose instead of where others decided for us."

"Yes." Grace's voice was soft. "That's exactly what we're doing."

"I've spent my whole life letting others choose my path. Teachers who decided I wasn't worth teaching. Neighbors who assumed I'd fail. My father who told me I'd never be more than he was." I picked up another stone, held it without throwing. "Even when I wanted more, I hid it. Hid the poetry, hid the hope, hid behind being the rough kid everyone expected."

"You're not hiding anymore."

"No. Thanks to you." I set down the stone, turned to face her properly. "You made me see that being worthy isn't about where you're from or what others expect. It's about who you choose to be. What you try for. Whether you're willing to be seen—really seen—instead of hiding behind whatever role feels safest."

Grace's eyes were bright with tears that hadn't fallen. "And are you? Willing to be seen?"

"With you, yeah. I am." The truth of it settled into my bones. "I can be a railroad worker and a poetry reader. Tough and tender. From the wrong side of the tracks and worthy of love. I can contain multitudes. I can be all of it instead of just the parts people expect."

"You've always contained multitudes." Grace touched my face gently. "I just helped you see it."

"You did more than that. You chose me when choosing me was hard. Stood up for me when staying silent would have been easier. Believed in me when I didn't believe in myself." My throat was tight. "You saved me, Grace."

"No." She shook her head. "You saved yourself. I just showed you that you could."

Maybe we were both right.

Maybe we'd saved each other.

The sun had nearly set, painting the sky in shades of purple and gold. The river kept flowing, endless and patient, dividing nothing that mattered.

"I'm scared," I admitted. "Your father's watching. The town's talking. I could still disappoint you. Could still prove everyone right."

"You could. Or you could prove them wrong. Or you could be something in between—human and flawed and trying." Grace moved closer. "I'm scared too. Scared of my father's disappointment. Scared the town will never accept us. Scared I'm not brave enough to keep choosing this when it gets hard."

"You're the bravest person I know."

"Then we'll be brave together." She smiled, eyes shining. "We'll be scared together and brave together and real together."

"Together," I echoed. "I like the sound of that."

"Me too."

We sat there in the fading light, the river singing its endless song, and I felt something I'd never felt before. Not just hope—though there was plenty of that. Not just love—though I was starting to understand that's what this overwhelming feeling was.

It was possibility. The sense that my life wasn't predetermined. That the railroad tracks dividing Copper Ridge didn't have to divide me from Grace, or me from my own future.

That I could choose.

"Grace?"

"Mm?"

"I'm going to kiss you now. If that's okay."

She pulled back just enough to meet my eyes, smiling. "That's very okay."

I cupped her face in my rough hands, thumbs brushing her cheeks, taking a moment to memorize this—her face in the sunset light, the sound of the river, the feel of possibility in the air.

Then I kissed her.

It was sweet at first, tentative, both of us learning. Then deeper as Grace's hands found my shoulders, as I pulled her closer, as the kiss became something that spoke of everything we'd been through to get here.

When we finally pulled apart, we were both breathing hard, both smiling like fools.

"Wow," Grace whispered.

"Yeah. Wow." I rested my forehead against hers. "Worth the wait?"

"Worth everything." She kissed me again, quick and joyful. "Worth standing up to the whole town. Worth all of it."

We sat there as darkness fell properly, wrapped in each other, watching stars appear one by one. Talking quietly about small things—what night classes would be like, whether teacher's college was scary, if we could read Whitman to the kids at the center together.

Making plans that weren't grand but were ours.

Eventually, reluctantly, we stood. Walked back toward town holding hands, the railroad tracks appearing as we approached.

"Still dividing the town," I observed.

"Let them divide the town." Grace squeezed my hand. "They don't divide us."

And they didn't. We crossed those tracks together, Grace's hand in mine, neither of us belonging to one side or the other exclusively.

We belonged to ourselves.

To the choices we'd made.

To each other.

The path ahead wouldn't be easy. Pastor Mitchell would watch me carefully, judging every choice. The town would talk, gossip, speculate. My father would have moments of bitterness mixed with encouragement. Grace's mother would worry.

There would be obstacles. Setbacks. Times when it would be easier to give up than keep trying.

But we'd face them together.

I looked at Grace, walking beside me in the darkness, and felt that possibility expand in my chest until it felt like flying.

This was just the beginning.

Not of some fairy tale where everything was perfect.

But of something real—messy and complicated and beautiful.

Of choosing to be more than what others expected.

Of claiming our own paths regardless of the well-worn roads others laid out for us.

Of loving someone brave enough to see you truly and choosing to be worthy of that sight.

The railroad tracks gleamed behind us in the moonlight—still there, still dividing Copper Ridge into two separate worlds.

But Grace and I were already beyond them.

Already choosing something different.

Already proving that love and courage and the willingness to try mattered more than geography or circumstances or what anyone said we should be.

We were choosing to be ourselves.

Together.

And that, I was beginning to understand, was the bravest choice of all.
