# Chapter 23: Revival Meeting

Sunday morning, Ma woke me an hour earlier than usual.

"Get up and put on your good clothes," she said from my doorway. "We're going to the revival meeting."

I pulled the pillow over my head. "I'm not going."

"Yes, you are. The whole family is going. It's a community event."

"I don't care about community events."

"Tommy Keane, you will get out of that bed, put on a clean shirt and your church pants, and you will sit with your family like a respectable person." Her voice had that edge that meant argument was pointless. "I don't ask much of you. I'm asking this."

I lay there after she left, staring at the water-stained ceiling. The revival meeting. Pastor Mitchell leading prayers and testimonies at Riverside Park. The whole town gathering to celebrate faith and community and all the things I'd stopped believing in.

Grace would be there.

That was the real reason I didn't want to go. Seeing her from a distance, unable to talk to her, watching her play perfect pastor's daughter while I stood on the edges where people like me belonged.

But Ma had asked. And Ma rarely asked for anything.

I got up and put on my good clothes.

The clothes were getting tight again. I'd filled out over the summer from all the extra work, shoulders broader, arms thicker. The shirt pulled across my back when I buttoned it. The pants were a little short. I looked like what I was—a kid trying to wear clothes he'd outgrown, pretending to be something he wasn't.

The drive to Riverside Park was silent. Frank drove, knuckles white on the steering wheel, clearly as thrilled about this as I was. Ma sat in the passenger seat looking satisfied. She'd gotten us into church clothes and into the car. That was victory enough.

Riverside Park sat along the bend in the river on the south edge of town, technically public land but mostly claimed by families from the right side of the tracks. A makeshift stage had been erected near the pavilion, American flag on one side, cross on the other. Rows of folding chairs fanned out from the stage, already filling up with Copper Ridge's finest.

We parked at the far edge of the lot—old habit. Our truck looked out of place among the newer cars, the Chevrolets and Buicks that belonged to families with names like Henderson and Walsh.

"Remember to be respectful," Ma said as we walked toward the gathering. "No matter what anyone says or does."

I wondered if she knew. If she'd somehow figured out about Grace, about the summer, about everything. Mothers had a way of knowing things you didn't tell them.

The crowd had already divided itself along invisible lines. Families from the right side of town clustered near the front, dressed in their Sunday best. A smaller contingent from our neighborhood gathered toward the back and sides, work-roughened hands and simpler clothes marking them as clearly as any sign.

Separate but together. That was Copper Ridge in a nutshell.

"There's the Johnsons," Ma said, spotting our neighbors. "Let's sit with them."

We settled into chairs near the back. Marty appeared a few minutes later with his family, sliding into the row behind us. He leaned forward, tapped my shoulder.

"Didn't think you'd come," he said quietly.

"Ma insisted."

"Yeah, mine too." He grinned slightly. "Something about community obligation and showing our faces."

"Exactly that."

Pastor Mitchell took the stage precisely at two o'clock. He looked every inch the respected leader in his dark suit, Bible in hand, gentle smile on his face. The crowd settled immediately.

"Good afternoon, friends," he began, voice carrying across the park. "What a blessing to see so many of you here today. This annual revival is one of my favorite traditions—a chance for our entire community to come together in fellowship and faith."

I resisted the urge to look around at the divided seating. Entire community together, as long as we all stayed in our assigned sections.

"Today I want to talk about love," Pastor Mitchell continued. "Not romantic love, but agape love—the love of community, of neighbor, of Christian fellowship that binds us together regardless of our differences."

The irony was thick enough to choke on. This man preaching about loving your neighbor despite differences had forbidden his daughter from volunteering in my neighborhood. Had declared me too dangerous, too rough, too wrong for his family to associate with.

I crossed my arms and tried to tune out his words.

But I couldn't help scanning the crowd for Grace.

I found her in the third row, sitting between her mother and an older woman I didn't recognize. She wore a blue dress, her hair pulled back neatly. Even from this distance, even surrounded by people, she looked alone.

And pale. Thinner than I remembered, though it had only been weeks since I'd seen her up close. She sat very straight, hands folded in her lap, perfect posture.

Perfect pastor's daughter.

Hollow.

As if she felt my gaze, Grace's head turned slightly. Not all the way around—that would be obvious. Just enough that she could see toward the back rows.

Our eyes met across fifty yards of grass and folding chairs and invisible class divisions.

My breath caught.

Her expression—God, her expression. It wasn't the carefully blank look she'd worn at church. Wasn't the polite mask I'd seen that Sunday in the parking lot.

It was desperate. Determined. Something fierce and fragile all at once.

Like she was trying to tell me something. Like she needed me to understand.

I didn't understand. Couldn't begin to.

Then her mother touched her arm gently, and Grace turned back to face the stage. But even watching the back of her head, I could see the tension in her shoulders. Could see her hands gripping each other tight enough to hurt.

Something was wrong. Or something was about to happen. I couldn't tell which.

"Tommy?" Marty's voice was low. "You okay?"

"Yeah," I lied, forcing my eyes back to the stage.

Pastor Mitchell was wrapping up his sermon, moving into the traditional open testimony portion of the revival. "And now," he said, spreading his arms welcomingly, "I'd like to open the floor to anyone who feels moved to share. Testimonies of faith, gratitude, reflections on our community and God's blessings. Who would like to begin?"

Silence.

It was always awkward, this part. Nobody wanted to be first. After a moment that stretched too long, old Mrs. Henderson stood.

"I just want to thank everyone for their support during Harold's illness," she said, her voice wavering. "The meals, the visits, the prayers—they meant the world to us. This community has such kind hearts."

People murmured approval. Mrs. Henderson sat down, looking relieved.

A young man I vaguely recognized from the hardware store stood next. "The youth group's been a real blessing in my life," he said. "Helped me find purpose and faith when I was feeling lost. I'm grateful for Pastor Mitchell's guidance."

More murmurs. More nodding heads.

A few more people shared—standard testimonies about blessings and answered prayers and community support. The kind of safe, expected sharing that made these events feel both comforting and hollow.

Then movement in the third row caught my eye.

Grace was standing.

My heart stopped.

Every head in the crowd turned. Pastor Mitchell's daughter, rising to speak. Of course people would pay attention. She was young, pretty, the perfect example of Christian youth. Whatever she had to say would be uplifting and appropriate and—

She walked to the front with measured steps. Not hurried, not hesitant. Deliberate. Like she'd made a decision and was seeing it through regardless of cost.

Pastor Mitchell looked surprised but pleased. Pride shone in his eyes. His daughter, participating in the revival, setting an example for the youth. He stepped aside, giving her the space in front of the congregation.

Grace stood there for a moment, looking out at everyone. At the church ladies in the front rows. At the families from both sides of the tracks. At her father standing supportive and unsuspecting beside the stage.

At me.

She looked directly at me for one long moment. Something in her eyes was asking a question I didn't understand. Or maybe saying goodbye. Or maybe—

Then she turned to address the full congregation.

"I want to talk about judgment," she began, her voice clear and carrying despite a slight tremor. "And about hypocrisy."

The crowd shifted. That wasn't the opening anyone had expected.

Pastor Mitchell's smile faltered slightly, but he maintained his encouraging expression. Probably thought she was going somewhere appropriate with this. Some youth group lesson about judging others, maybe.

He had no idea.

I had no idea.

But Grace's hands were shaking where she gripped them together. Her voice might be clear, but she was terrified.

And she kept talking anyway.

"We come here today to celebrate community," she continued. "To talk about Christian love and fellowship and accepting our neighbors. We quote scripture about loving one another, about not judging by appearances, about how God looks at the heart while man looks at the outward appearance."

She paused, scanning the crowd again.

"But do we actually believe that? Or do we just say it because it sounds nice?"

Dead silence. You could have heard a pin drop in that park.

Pastor Mitchell was no longer smiling.

Grace's mother had gone very still, one hand pressed to her chest.

Margaret Walsh looked scandalized.

And I sat frozen in my chair, unable to breathe, unable to move, unable to do anything but watch as Grace Mitchell—perfect pastor's daughter, obedient girl who'd chosen her father's authority over her own heart—stood in front of the entire town and began to dismantle everything they believed.

Everything I'd believed about her choice.

"This summer," Grace said, and her voice only shook slightly, "I volunteered at the community center. In the neighborhood we politely call 'the wrong side of the tracks.'"

Her eyes found mine again across the distance.

"And I learned something about judgment."

My heart was hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears.

What was she doing?

What was about to happen?

Grace took a breath, standing taller.

And began to speak truth to a town that didn't want to hear it.
