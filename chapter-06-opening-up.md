# Chapter 6: Opening Up

Grace came to the center three times a week now, regular as clockwork. Somehow, without planning it, we'd developed a rhythm.

She taught reading groups. I did maintenance. We both watched the kids—her from inside, me from the basketball court. If something broke, I fixed it. If the kids got too wild, we both stepped in. It felt natural.

And she started asking me things. Not pleasantries—actual questions. Real ones.

Tuesday afternoon, I was replacing a broken window when Grace found me.

"Can I ask you something about Danny?"

"Sure."

"He's so smart, but the minute we open a book, he shuts down. What would help?"

Nobody ever asked what I thought about things that mattered. But Grace stood there waiting, genuinely wanting my answer.

"He's embarrassed," I said finally. "Being twelve and reading like a third-grader. In front of the younger kids."

"So you think he needs one-on-one time?"

"Maybe. Or give him stuff to read that makes him feel older, not younger. Car magazines. Sports news. Stuff that looks like what a man would read."

Grace considered this. "That makes sense. I could bring some from my father's study. He gets the newspaper and Life magazine."

"Danny would probably like that better than kid books."

"Thank you. That's really helpful." And she meant it—I could tell by the way she looked at me, like I'd said something valuable.

Thursday she asked about the Rodriguez kids. Saturday about reaching a new boy. Each time, I found myself talking more than usual. Explaining things I'd never put into words.

"Kids here get written off early," I told her one afternoon. We were watching kickball in the back lot. "Teachers see the address, the clothes. They stop expecting much."

"That's horrible," Grace said quietly.

"It's how it is. So these kids—they stop expecting much from themselves too. Figure if nobody believes in them, why bother trying?"

"But you try. You dropped out, but you read poetry. You work hard here."

I shrugged, uncomfortable. "I'm nobody special."

"I don't think that's true."

I didn't know how to respond to that, so I didn't. But her words stuck with me long after she'd gone back inside.

Grace listened. Really listened. When I talked, she paid attention like my words mattered. She'd ask follow-up questions, take mental notes, actually use what I told her.

Nobody had ever treated what I thought as valuable before.

Late June brought a heat wave. Air thick enough to chew, sweat soaking through your shirt by ten in the morning. The rail yard was brutal—metal hot enough to burn, sun beating down relentless.

By the time I got to the center in the afternoons, I was exhausted.

Saturday morning, I showed up to fix the basketball hoop. It had been listing sideways for weeks, and I'd finally found time to properly reset the pole. It meant digging, cement mixing, the kind of work that was miserable in this heat but necessary.

I'd been at it for maybe an hour when I heard the back door open.

"Tommy?"

I looked up from the hole I was digging. Grace stood in the doorway holding a glass.

"Thought you might want this."

She walked over, careful to stay in the shade, and handed me a glass of lemonade. Condensation beaded on the outside, and I could see ice cubes floating in the pale yellow liquid.

"Thanks." I downed half of it in one go. It was cold and sweet and tasted like heaven after the heat.

"That looks like hard work," Grace said, looking at the hole and the pile of broken concrete I'd pulled out.

"It needs doing."

"Still. It's got to be ninety degrees out here."

"Probably." I finished the lemonade and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. "Thanks for this. I needed it."

"There's more inside if you want."

I should've kept my distance. But standing in that shade with Grace, the heat making everything slow, I nodded.

"Yeah. Let me finish this."

"I'll wait."

She stood in the shade, watching me work. I was conscious of every movement. But when I glanced at her, she wasn't looking at me like I was dirty or beneath her. Just watching. Curious.

I tamped down the concrete, wiped my hands on my work pants, and followed her inside.

The center was cooler, but not by much. We didn't have air conditioning, just fans that pushed the hot air around. Grace poured me another glass of lemonade from the pitcher Mrs. Kowalski kept in the old refrigerator.

"Where's Mrs. Kowalski?" I asked.

"Had to run to the store for supplies. The kids won't be here for another hour." Grace handed me the glass. "Do you want to sit?"

We sat at one of the round tables, the same kind where she taught the kids. Through the window, I could see the basketball hoop listing at its sad angle, waiting for me to finish.

"How's the rail yard been?" Grace asked.

"Hot. Everything's hot."

She smiled. "I imagine. My father was complaining about how hot the church gets during services. He said it's like preaching in an oven."

"At least he's not loading freight in it."

"True." She took a sip of her own lemonade. "Do you ever think about doing something else? Besides the railroad?"

The question surprised me. "Like what?"

"I don't know. You're good at fixing things. You could maybe work at a garage, or start your own repair business."

I shook my head. "That takes money. Tools, space, reputation. I've got none of that."

"But you could build it. You're only eighteen."

"Keane men work the railroad," I said, echoing what I'd told the kids during that storm. "That's just how it is."

"But does it have to be?"

I looked at her. She was serious, not just making conversation. Actually asking if I'd ever considered a different life than the one laid out for me.

"You sound like the poetry I read," I said.

"The Whitman?"

"Yeah. 'Song of the Open Road.' All about choosing your path, going wherever you want."

"And you don't think you can?"

I gestured around the room. "I'm from here, Grace. This neighborhood. This side of town. There's not a lot of choosing involved. You work the jobs available, you make enough to get by, and that's it."

"But what if it didn't have to be that way?"

"Then I'd be someone else living somewhere else. But I'm not."

She was quiet for a moment, turning her glass in her hands. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push."

"You didn't." I drained my lemonade and set the glass down. "Most people from your side of town don't think about guys like me at all. At least you're asking."

"Is that a compliment or an insult?"

"Haven't decided yet."

She laughed at that, a real laugh that lit up her whole face. "Fair enough."

We sat there for a minute, not talking. Outside, I could hear kids' voices in the distance—some of them arriving early, eager to claim the good basketball before everyone else showed up. The fans hummed. Somewhere down the street, someone's radio played Elvis.

"Can I ask you something?" Grace said.

"Sure."

"Why do you volunteer here? I know you said these kids are like you were, but... there's more to it than that, isn't there?"

I considered the question. Thought about the real answer versus the easy answer I usually gave.

"When I was growing up, there wasn't a place like this," I said finally. "There was school, where teachers didn't care. There was home, which was... complicated. And there was the streets. That was it. The streets meant guys like Eddie Russo and his crew—trouble waiting to happen."

"Eddie?"

"Someone I used to run with. Before I figured out that path led nowhere I wanted to go."

Grace nodded, listening.

"So when Mrs. Kowalski started this place, started giving kids somewhere else to be, somewhere they could just be kids... I don't know. I wanted to help with that. Make sure it stayed open. Make sure kids like Danny and Maria had what I didn't—someone who gave a damn."

The words came out rougher than I meant them to. More honest than I usually got with anyone.

Grace reached across the table. For a second, I thought she might take my hand, but she just rested hers on the table near mine.

"That's a good reason," she said quietly. "A really good reason."

I looked at her hand, so close to mine. Clean nails, smooth skin. Everything about her was clean and smooth and from a different world. But sitting here talking to her didn't feel like crossing enemy lines. It felt... easy.

That realization hit me like a freight train.

We'd been sitting here talking for twenty minutes. Maybe longer. Just talking like normal people. About the center, about the kids, about Mrs. Kowalski's shoestring budget and her hope to maybe afford new books in the fall. About small things and bigger things and nothing in particular.

And it had felt natural. Comfortable. Easy.

I stood up abruptly, my chair scraping against the floor.

"I should get back to that hoop."

Grace looked surprised by my sudden movement but nodded. "Of course. Let me know if you need anything else."

"Thanks for the lemonade."

"Anytime."

I headed outside, back to the heat and the work and the safe, concrete problem of a listing basketball hoop. Problems I could solve with tools and sweat and effort.

Not like the problem growing inside me—the awareness that I'd just spent the better part of half an hour talking to Grace Mitchell like she was a friend. Like we were friends. Like the railroad tracks that divided this town into right and wrong sides didn't exist.

I mixed concrete with more force than necessary, trying to push away the tight feeling in my chest.

Because this was dangerous. Getting comfortable with her was dangerous. Starting to think of her as someone I could talk to, someone who saw me as more than just the guy who fixed things—that was the most dangerous thing of all.

Grace Mitchell lived on the right side of town. She had a future that didn't include rundown community centers and boys with coal dust under their nails. She'd go to college or get married to someone from a good family, and she'd forget all about this summer volunteering with the poor kids.

Which meant I needed to remember that. Needed to keep my distance. Needed to stop letting easy conversations and genuine smiles make me forget the truth.

I reset the basketball hoop pole, packed cement around it, checked it for level. Fixed the problem.

If only the other problem was that easy to solve.
