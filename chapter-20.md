# Chapter 20: Staying Away

I stopped going to the community center.

Just stopped. Didn't announce it or tell Mrs. Kowalski. Just stopped showing up. Drove straight home from the rail yard instead of making that turn toward the neighborhood where the center sat, where Grace had been, where I'd briefly believed I could be something more.

Better this way. For everyone.

For Grace—she didn't need to run into me, didn't need reminders. For the kids, who deserved volunteers who wouldn't get into public fights. For Mrs. Kowalski, who'd given me a chance and watched me prove the doubters right.

For me. Especially for me.

Going back would mean facing what I'd lost, what I'd never really had. Would mean seeing the storage room where we'd talked about poetry, the corner where she'd brought me lemonade. Every inch of that place would remind me of her.

So I stayed away.

Final week of August felt endless. Summer dying, taking any hope with it. Fall would bring Grace's senior year—school, college applications, the life she was supposed to live.

And I'd be here, loading freight cars. Same as always.

Tuesday afternoon I was wrestling with a heavy crate when I heard a kid's voice.

"Tommy!"

I looked up, squinting against the afternoon sun, and saw Danny Porter standing at the edge of the loading area. He looked small against the massive freight cars, out of place in his worn sneakers and too-big t-shirt.

"Danny?" I set down the crate, wiping sweat from my forehead. "What are you doing here? You can't be—this isn't a safe place for kids."

"I know. But you wouldn't come to the center, so I came here." He walked closer, defiant despite his size. "Mrs. Kowalski said you haven't been around. Nobody's seen you."

"I've been busy. Work's been—" I gestured at the freight cars. "There's a lot of work."

"That's bull." Danny crossed his thin arms. "You're staying away because of what happened. Because of the fight and Miss Grace."

Smart kid. Too smart for his own good.

"Listen, Danny—"

"The kids miss you. Joey's been asking when you're coming back. Sammy too. Even Mrs. Kowalski asked about you yesterday." Danny's voice cracked slightly. "Center's not the same without you."

Something in my chest twisted. "They'll be fine. Mrs. Kowalski—"

"Mrs. Kowalski's doing her best, but she can't fix everything that breaks. And Eddie's been around again."

My hands clenched into fists. "Has he talked to you?"

"Not to me. But he's been hanging around after we leave, watching. Tommy Russo said Eddie's been asking about different kids. Younger ones." Danny met my eyes. "We need you there."

"You don't need me." I forced my hands to unclench. "You need to keep your head down. Stay away from Eddie and his crew. Listen to Mrs. Kowalski. Do your homework. Stay out of trouble."

"That's it?" Danny's voice rose. "That's all you got? Generic advice you can't even follow yourself?"

"Watch your mouth—"

"You told me not to give up. Told me Eddie was wrong, that I was better than what he was offering." Danny's eyes were bright, maybe with tears, maybe with anger. "But you're giving up. You're letting them win."

"This is different—"

"How? Because it's you? Because it's hard?" He shook his head, disgusted. "I thought you were different, Tommy. Thought you actually believed all that stuff you said about not staying where people put you. But you're just like everyone else. Soon as things get tough, you quit."

The words hit harder than Eddie's fists ever had. Coming from this twelve-year-old kid who'd looked up to me, who I'd tried to protect, who deserved better than watching another adult give up.

"Danny—"

"Forget it." He turned away, shoulders hunched. "I get it. Miss Grace was right to leave. Why would she stay for someone who gives up this easy?"

He walked off before I could respond, disappearing around a freight car. I stood there holding my half-loaded crate, Danny's words echoing in the diesel-scented air.

You're giving up.

You're just like everyone else.

Soon as things get tough, you quit.

I wanted to run after him, explain that this wasn't giving up—it was accepting reality. Being realistic. Staying where I belonged so I wouldn't hurt anyone else with my impossible hopes.

But my feet wouldn't move.

Because maybe Danny was right.

Maybe I was giving up. Quitting. Letting everyone's low expectations define me because it was easier than fighting them.

I loaded the crate with more force than necessary, welcoming the burn in my shoulders. Didn't want to think about Danny's disappointed face. Didn't want to think about anything.

But thinking was all I seemed capable of doing anymore.

I started taking extra shifts. If the foreman needed someone to work late, I volunteered. Weekend overtime? Sign me up. Anything to fill the hours, to exhaust myself so completely that sleep came quick and dreamless.

The other guys noticed.

"Keane's trying to buy his own freight car," one of them joked during lunch break. "Gonna live in it, probably."

"Nah, he's saving up for something big. Girl, maybe."

"Or running from one," Marty said quietly, too quietly for the others to hear. But I heard.

I didn't respond. Just ate my sandwich and stared at the trains.

There were always trains. Coming and going, carrying freight and passengers to places I'd never see. Cleveland. Pittsburgh. Chicago. Somewhere. Anywhere but here.

I found myself watching them obsessively. The passenger trains especially, windows full of people heading elsewhere. Where were they going? What were they leaving behind? Did they feel relief when Copper Ridge disappeared from view, or did they look back with regret?

"You keep staring at those trains like that, you're gonna hop one someday," Marty observed on Thursday.

"Maybe I should."

"And go where? Do what?" He bit into his apple. "You got no money, no plan, no prospects anywhere else either. You'd just be broke and lonely in a different town instead of broke and lonely here."

"Thanks for the encouragement."

"I'm being realistic. Something you used to be good at before you got all twisted up over that church girl." Marty studied me. "You're working yourself to death, Tommy. Double shifts every day this week. You look like hell."

"At least I'll die useful."

"That's not funny."

"Wasn't joking." I crumpled my lunch bag, tossed it in the barrel. "Work's all I'm good for, right? Might as well lean into it."

"Jesus, Tommy." Marty grabbed my arm as I stood to leave. "You can't keep doing this. Whatever happened with the girl—"

"There was no girl." The lie tasted bitter but necessary. "There was never any girl. I got confused for a minute, forgot my place. Now I remember. That's all."

"Your place?" Marty looked disgusted. "What the hell does that mean?"

"It means I'm a guy from the wrong side of the tracks who loads freight cars for a living. That's what I am. That's all I'll ever be. Everyone's been trying to tell me that my whole life, and I finally listened."

I pulled my arm free and walked back to work. Behind me, I heard Marty swear, but he didn't follow.

Good.

I didn't want company. Didn't want advice or sympathy or whatever he thought I needed.

I wanted to work until my body ached too much to feel anything else.

The days blurred. Wake before dawn. Rail yard. Load freight. Lunch watching trains I'd never board. Load more freight. Home after dark. Eat. Bed. Repeat.

Safe. Predictable. Numb.

Friday night I found my father on the porch, nursing his bottle. He looked up, took in my exhausted face.

"You're gonna break yourself working like this."

"I'm fine."

"You're not. You're turning into me." Frank drank. "Working yourself to death trying not to feel. Doesn't work. Just makes you bitter."

"I don't want to talk about it."

"Never said you did." He stared at the distant tracks under streetlights. "But I was wrong."

I paused. "About what?"

"What I said about nice girls and boys like us." Frank's voice was rough. "You're better than me, Tommy. Smarter. Kinder. You could be more if you let yourself."

"Frank—"

"I know I don't say it." He kept staring at those distant tracks. "Your ma tells me I'm too hard on you. She's right. I see all my wasted chances when I look at you, makes me mean. That's my failing, not yours."

Frank had never talked like this, never admitted regret.

"The pastor's daughter. If she saw something in you, maybe there was something to see. Maybe it's worth fighting for." He looked at me. "Don't give up just because it's hard. That's what I did. Look where it got me."

He turned back to his bottle, conversation over.

I went inside, Frank's words following me. Don't give up just because it's hard.

But I had given up. Danny was right. Frank was right. I'd let one fight, one setback, one pastor's decree convince me I was exactly what everyone said.

I'd proven them right by believing them.

The realization should have changed something. Should have made me want to fight back, prove them wrong, reclaim whatever I'd lost.

Instead, it just made me tired.

I was good for loading freight. Good for hard labor. Good for staying on my side of the tracks and not reaching for things beyond my grasp.

Grace was a beautiful fantasy I should never have entertained. The railroad tracks divided Copper Ridge for good reason. Some people crossed them, lived in both worlds, belonged everywhere.

Most people didn't.

Most people stayed where they were born, accepted their lot, lived quiet lives of resignation.

I was one of the most people.

Always had been.

I'd just forgotten for a while.

But I remembered now. And remembering was like building a wall, brick by brick. A wall between me and hope, me and wanting, me and the belief that I could be more.

The wall felt safe. Felt necessary.

Felt like giving up.

But I built it anyway.

Because giving up hurt less than hoping and failing.

Because staying numb felt better than feeling everything I'd lost.

Because boys like me didn't get girls like Grace, and the sooner I accepted that, the sooner I could get back to the life I was meant for.

Loading freight.

Watching trains leave without me.

Dying slowly on my side of the tracks, just like my father, just like his father before him.

Some things never changed.

Some walls couldn't be crossed.

Some boys never got to be more than what they were born to be.

I understood that now.

Finally.

Completely.

Even if understanding felt an awful lot like dying inside.
