# Chapter 26: Tommy's Fear

The week after the revival meeting, Copper Ridge buzzed with talk.

Grace's speech had divided the town. Half saw a brave girl speaking truth. The other half saw a disrespectful daughter. Everyone had an opinion. Everyone was talking.

And everyone had seen Grace approach me in that parking lot.

At the rail yard, conversations stopped when I walked past. By Wednesday, three people had asked about my "relationship with the pastor's daughter."

I didn't know how to answer because I didn't know what we were. We'd talked. She'd said she cared. I'd admitted I cared. Then her father had approached and we'd agreed to talk to him together.

And I'd panicked.

Told Grace maybe we should wait. She'd looked disappointed but agreed. Then I'd spent four days avoiding the center, avoiding Grace, avoiding everything.

Grace had been brave. Had risked everything.

And I'd hidden at the rail yard, terrified.

Thursday afternoon, Mrs. Kowalski showed up at the yard.

"Tommy Keane, if I have to come down here one more time—" She was out of breath, flushed.

"Mrs. Kowalski—"

"The center needs you. Danny Porter's been asking for you every day. And Grace has been there every afternoon asking when you're coming back."

Guilt twisted in my gut. "Tell her I'm busy."

"She doesn't believe it. Neither do I." Mrs. Kowalski's eyes were sharp. "She risked everything for you. And you're hiding down here."

"It matters. That's why I'm staying away." The words came out sharp. "She put herself at risk. The least I can do is not make it worse."

"By being the person she believes you are?" Mrs. Kowalski shook her head. "You're leaving her to face the consequences alone."

The words hit like a fist.

"I can't be what she needs. Can't be worth what she risked."

"Stop. Stop believing you're not worthy." Mrs. Kowalski's voice gentled. "That's the real problem. Not her father, not the town—you. You're convinced you don't deserve her."

I looked away.

"Come to the center today. Talk to her. Face this instead of running."

She left.

I finished my shift in a daze, her words circling. By five o'clock, my hands were shaking as I pulled up to the center.

Inside, kids were everywhere. In the corner, teaching Danny and two other boys, was Grace.

She looked up when I walked in. Our eyes met.

The center seemed to pause. Everyone waiting.

Grace stood, said something quiet to Danny, and walked toward me.

"Hi."

"Hi."

We stood awkwardly while everyone watched.

"Can we talk? In the storage room?"

I nodded, following her into the small room where we'd first discussed poetry.

Grace closed the door. "You've been avoiding me."

"Yeah."

"Why?"

"Because I'm scared. Terrified."

"Of what?"

"Of disappointing you." The words tumbled out. "You risked everything. And I keep thinking—what if they're all right? What if I am exactly what your father thinks? What if you're wrong about me?"

"I'm not wrong."

"You don't know that." I pushed my hand through my hair. "I'm still a railroad worker with no future. You're the pastor's daughter with college and a bright life waiting. Together we face judgment, gossip, your family upset. Is it worth it? You're going to lose things because of me. Your father's approval. Your place in the community. For what? A guy who can't offer you anything?"

"Do you care about me?" she asked.

"Of course I do."

"Do you think I'm worth fighting for?"

"Grace, you're worth—" I stopped, seeing where she was going.

"So why don't you think you're worth fighting for?" Her voice was gentle but relentless. "Why do you believe I'm worth the risk but you're not? Why do you believe everyone's low opinion more than my assessment? Why is town gossip more trustworthy than Mrs. Kowalski or Danny or your own knowledge of who you are?"

I had no answer.

"You keep telling me about obstacles. My father, the town, your circumstances. But those aren't the real obstacles. The real obstacle is you. Your belief you don't deserve good things."

"I'm being realistic—"

"You're being defeatist. There's a difference." Her eyes were fierce. "Realistic is acknowledging challenges while trying anyway. Defeatist is using them as an excuse to give up before you start."

"I'm not—"

"Then what's avoiding me for four days? Hiding at the rail yard? Telling yourself you're not good enough when I'm telling you that you are?"

She was right.

I'd been using everyone's opinions as armor against risk. Using my circumstances as proof I didn't deserve to try.

"You're scared," Grace said, softening. "I get it. I'm scared too. But you know what scares me more? You giving up on yourself. Accepting everyone's limitations instead of discovering your possibilities."

"I don't know how to believe I'm worth this."

"Then start small." She took my hand. "Start by believing maybe I'm not delusional. That when I see something good in you, it might actually be there."

"And if I disappoint you?"

"What if you don't? What if you try and succeed?" She squeezed my hand. "You're so afraid of failing you won't even try. But that's the only guaranteed way to fail. Not trying."

I looked down at our joined hands. Hers small and pale, mine rough from work. The contrast still there, still obvious.

But maybe contrast didn't mean incompatible.

Maybe it just meant different.

"Your father—"

"Is struggling with what I said. My mother's been talking to him, helping him see his own prejudices. It's slow, but he's listening." Grace's voice was gentle. "He loves me. He'll come around eventually. But even if he doesn't, that doesn't change how I feel."

"The town—"

"Will talk no matter what we do. Let them talk." She lifted her chin. "I'm done living my life based on other people's opinions. I'd rather be real and judged than fake and approved."

"I have nothing to offer you. No money, no prospects—"

"I'm not asking you to be rich. I'm not asking you to be perfect." Grace's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "I'm asking you to try. To believe you deserve good things. To trust that maybe you're worth the risk I'm taking."

The words hung between us in the small storage room where we'd first connected over Whitman's poetry. Where she'd seen me reading and hadn't laughed. Where she'd sat with me and discussed meaning and beauty like I had thoughts worth hearing.

Where she'd made me feel like maybe I was more than everyone said.

"I don't want to hurt you," I said quietly. "Don't want to be the guy who drags you down or proves your father right or—"

"Then don't be that guy. Be the guy I've seen at this center. The one who protects kids and reads poetry and thinks about things deeply. Be the person you want to be, not the person everyone expects."

"What if I can't?"

"What if you can?" Grace stepped closer, both her hands holding mine now. "What if, instead of assuming the worst, you try for the best? What if, instead of believing everyone who's told you you're nothing, you believe the people who see something more?"

I looked at her—really looked. At the girl who'd stood up in front of her entire community and called out their hypocrisy. Who'd defended me when it would have been easier to stay silent. Who'd walked across a parking lot despite everyone watching because she'd decided I was worth it.

Who was standing here now, asking me to believe I was worth her faith.

Could I? Could I set aside years of being told I was limited, rough, destined for nothing? Could I trust her vision of who I might be over everyone else's conviction of who I was?

"I'm terrified of failing you," I said.

"I'm terrified too. But I'm more terrified of what happens if we don't try." Grace's voice was steady. "Life's too short to live in fear, Tommy. Too short to accept limitations others put on us."

I thought about my father, bitter and broken, warning me I'd end up just like him. About teachers who'd written me off. About the town that had decided who I was before I'd had a chance to decide for myself.

About how I'd started believing them all.

And then I thought about Grace's courage. About Danny's admiration. About Mrs. Kowalski's faith. About the poetry I read in secret because it made me feel like maybe there was more to me than loading freight.

About how, for a few brief weeks this summer, I'd felt like I could be something different.

Someone different.

"Okay," I said.

"Okay?"

"Okay, I'll try." The words felt like jumping off a cliff. "I'll stop believing everyone's worst opinions. I'll... I'll try to see what you apparently see."

Grace's smile was like sunrise breaking through storm clouds.

"That's all I'm asking. Just try. Be yourself—the real yourself, not the limited version everyone else decided on."

"I can't promise I won't mess up."

"I don't need promises. I need honesty. I need you to try." She squeezed my hands. "And I need you to believe you're worth trying for. Can you do that?"

Could I?

I looked at Grace—brave, determined, choosing me despite every reason not to. Looked around this storage room where we'd first connected. Thought about the kids outside who looked up to me, who saw something worth admiring.

Maybe they were all seeing something I'd been too afraid to look at.

Maybe it was time to try.

"Yeah," I said. "I can try."

"Then that's enough." Grace pulled me into a hug, and I wrapped my arms around her, holding on like she was the only solid thing in a world that had just shifted on its axis.

Maybe I was worth fighting for.

Maybe I could be better than everyone said.

Maybe choosing to try was the bravest thing I could do.

"We should talk to your father," I said into her hair. "Together. For real this time."

Grace pulled back, nodding. "Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow," I agreed.

And for the first time in weeks—maybe in my life—I felt like maybe I deserved the chance she was offering.

Maybe I could be worth it after all.
