# Chapter 5: Unexpected Genuineness

By the third week of June, Grace had been coming to the center three times a week like clockwork. She was part of the routine now.

I noticed she'd changed her approach. She didn't try so hard to be perfect anymore. When the kids got rowdy, she got firm without getting flustered. She'd started bringing books that actually interested them—adventure stories, comics, baseball biographies.

The kids responded. They still gave her trouble sometimes, but regular trouble, not the specific testing from those first weeks. She'd earned her place here.

And she'd started greeting me. Actually greeting me—"Hi, Tommy" when she arrived, "How was the rail yard?" while I fixed things. Like she saw me as a person, not just the maintenance guy.

I didn't know what to do with it.

Thursday afternoon, I was replacing rotted boards on the back steps when Grace arrived.

"Hi, Tommy."

I looked up. She stood in the doorway with her canvas bag, wearing a green dress.

"Hey."

"How's the rail yard?"

"Same as always. Hot. Loud."

She smiled. "So basically another day at the office."

I blinked. Was she making a joke about my work at the freight yard?

"Yeah."

"I'll let you work. Just wanted to say hi."

She disappeared inside. I turned back to the boards, mind stuck on that brief exchange. The easy way she'd talked to me, like it was normal.

Inside, I could hear her setting up for the reading group. The kids arrived gradually—Danny Porter first, then the Rodriguez kids, a couple others. Their voices drifted through the open windows, Grace's among them.

I finished with the steps and gathered my tools. The sky to the west was darkening, clouds building up thick and gray. We were in for a storm.

I headed inside just as thunder rolled across town.

"Sounds like a big one coming," Mrs. Kowalski said.

Ten minutes later, the power went out.

The storm hit hard—wind rattling windows, rain hammering the roof. Lightning flashed, followed by thunder that shook the building. Then darkness.

The kids squealed, excited and scared.

"Everyone stay where you are," Mrs. Kowalski called. "Tommy, candles in the supply closet."

I navigated in the dark, found candles and matches. Mrs. Kowalski had herded the kids to the center, away from windows.

I lit candles and placed them around the room. Flickering light cast dancing shadows on the walls.

"Well," Grace said, looking around at the gathered kids, "I guess this is an adventure."

"I don't like storms," little Maria said in her small voice.

"The building's safe," I told her. "Solid brick. Been standing since 1924. Storm isn't going to hurt it."

Maria looked at me with big eyes, then nodded, reassured.

Thunder boomed again. The kids were getting restless. This could go bad fast.

Grace seemed to realize it. "Who wants to tell stories?"

"Any kind. Real ones, made-up ones, whatever you want."

Smart move. The kids agreed, settling into a circle on the floor. Grace sat with them, Mrs. Kowalski took a chair. I stayed by the window, watching.

The stories started—Maria's cat catching a mouse, the Carter twin's exaggerated fishing tale, Danny's car accident story.

Grace listened to each one like it mattered. Thunder rolled outside, rain poured, but inside the candlelight, the kids were engaged.

After about the fifth kid, Grace looked around. Her eyes landed on me.

"Tommy, do you have a story?"

Every kid turned to look at me.

I shifted my weight, uncomfortable. "I'm not part of the circle."

"You're part of the center," Grace said. "Come on. Just one story."

I could've refused. Should've refused. But there was something in the way she asked—genuine interest, no pressure, just an invitation—that made it hard to say no.

And the kids were all watching me, waiting.

I pushed off from the wall and moved closer to the circle, still standing. "All right. One story."

"Is it a true story?" Maria asked.

"True story. About my grandfather."

I took a breath, trying to figure out where to start. I'd never told this story before, not out loud. It was just something I knew, family history passed down.

"My grandfather—my pa's father—worked the railroad back in the twenties and thirties, when things were different. Harder. More dangerous. They didn't have all the safety rules they have now. Men got hurt all the time, sometimes killed."

The kids were quiet, listening.

"One winter, there was a big accident waiting to happen. A freight car loaded with steel got loose on a hill outside of town. The brakes failed, and it started rolling downhill, picking up speed. At the bottom of that hill was the switching station where my grandfather worked."

"What's a switching station?" one of the younger boys asked.

"Place where they control which tracks the trains go on. Important job. My grandfather was in there that day with two other men when someone ran in shouting that the freight car was coming and it couldn't stop."

I had their attention now, all of them leaning forward.

"The other two men ran. Just took off out the back, trying to save themselves. But my grandfather knew if that freight car crashed into the station at full speed, it could derail other trains. People could die. So he stayed."

"That's stupid," one of the Carter twins said. "He should've run."

"Maybe. But he didn't. He worked the switches fast as he could, routing that runaway car onto a side track—an empty track that led to a dead end. The car was going so fast he could hear it coming, feel it in the rails. He finished just in time, got the last switch thrown and jumped out the window right before the car crashed past where he'd been standing."

"Did it crash?" Maria asked breathlessly.

"Crashed into the barrier at the end of the track. Made a sound like the whole world was ending. But it stopped. And because my grandfather routed it right, no other trains got hurt. No people got hurt."

"Except your grandfather?" Grace asked quietly.

I looked at her. She was watching me with that expression again—like she was seeing something worth seeing.

"He broke his arm jumping out the window. But he said that was better than being dead."

"Did he get in trouble for breaking his arm?" Maria asked.

"No. He got a commendation. A letter from the railroad company saying he'd shown exceptional bravery. My father still has it."

"That's a good story," Danny said, and several other kids nodded.

"Is that why you work the railroad?" Grace asked. "Because your grandfather did?"

The question cut closer than I expected. I shrugged. "Keane men work the railroad. That's just how it is."

"But your grandfather was a hero," little Maria said. "Are you a hero too?"

The innocent question from her hit different than it would have from anyone else. I crouched down so I was at her eye level.

"No, Maria. I just load freight cars. Nothing heroic about it. But my grandfather—yeah, he was brave. And I'm glad he was, because if he'd run that day, I might not be here."

Thunder rumbled again, but quieter now. The storm was moving east, the worst of it past. Outside, the rain was letting up.

And then the lights flickered and came back on.

The kids cheered. Mrs. Kowalski started blowing out candles, declaring the adventure over. The kids scattered to their previous activities, the spell of the story circle broken.

I stood, ready to get back to work on something, anything that would let me avoid thinking about how it had felt telling that story with everyone listening.

"Tommy."

I turned. Grace stood there, her canvas bag in hand, that thoughtful look still on her face.

"That was a good story. The way you told it—you made them feel it. They were right there with you."

"It's just something that happened a long time ago."

"But the way you shared it mattered. You're good with them, you know. The kids. They trust you."

I didn't know what to say to that. She'd told me before I was good with the kids, but this felt different. More personal.

"They trust anyone who pays attention to them," I said finally.

"That's not true." Grace shifted her bag to her other shoulder. "They trust people who are real with them. Who don't talk down to them or pretend to be something they're not."

She held my gaze for a moment longer, then smiled and headed toward the reading corner to clean up.

I stood there in the middle of the room, kids running around me, Mrs. Kowalski humming as she returned candles to the closet, Grace organizing books across the room.

And I realized something that made my chest feel tight.

Grace Mitchell wasn't just going through the motions of volunteering. She wasn't here to feel good about herself or to have something impressive to put on a college application. She genuinely cared—about the kids, about doing the work well, about seeing people as they actually were instead of what she expected them to be.

She was real in a way that most people weren't. Genuine.

And that was dangerous.

Because it made me want to believe that maybe the divide between us wasn't as impossible as I'd convinced myself it was. Made me want to think that maybe someone like her could actually see someone like me and not be just going through polite motions.

Made me want things I had no right wanting.

I picked up my toolbox and headed back outside to finish the work on the steps. The rain had stopped, leaving everything fresh and clean, the air cool and sharp.

But the tight feeling in my chest didn't go away.
