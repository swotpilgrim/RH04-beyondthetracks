# Chapter 3: Keeping Distance

Grace came to the center three times that first week. I made sure to stay as far away from her as possible.

Tuesday afternoon, she was teaching her first reading group—five kids ranging from eight to twelve, all of them struggling. I was outside replacing the chain-link fence section that had been sagging for months, but I could see through the window.

She sat at one of the round tables with the kids gathered around. Even from a distance, I could tell she was nervous—her posture was too straight, her smile too bright. The kids sensed it the way animals sense fear. They tested her immediately.

The Carter twins kept interrupting each other. Little Maria wouldn't speak above a whisper. Danny Porter, who was twelve but read at a third-grade level, sat with his arms crossed and his face closed off.

I bent another section of fence wire, watching Grace try to maintain order. She was patient, I'd give her that. When the twins talked over her, she waited them out instead of yelling. When Maria's voice dropped too low, Grace leaned in to hear instead of demanding she speak up.

And when Danny muttered that this was stupid and he didn't need to read anyway, Grace didn't argue. She just asked him what he liked to do. Danny shrugged. Grace waited. Eventually, Danny said he liked cars. Grace found a magazine article about the new Chevrolet models and asked if he wanted to read about them.

Danny hesitated, but he took the magazine.

I turned back to the fence, irritated that I'd been watching at all. It wasn't my business how Grace ran her reading groups.

Thursday she was back. I was fixing the broken basketball hoop in the back lot, but I could hear her through the open windows. This time her voice was steadier. She'd brought different materials—comic books alongside the textbooks Mrs. Kowalski provided.

Smart. Kids like these weren't going to care about Dick and Jane stories. They needed Batman and Superman, cowboys and car chases. Anything that made reading feel less like school and more like escape.

I could hear Danny actually engaged this time, reading aloud haltingly about Superman stopping a runaway train. Grace praised his effort without making a big deal of it, just a simple "good job" that didn't embarrass him in front of the other kids.

When the session ended, the kids scattered to play. I watched Grace sit back in her chair, shoulders relaxing like she'd been holding her breath the whole hour. She pushed hair behind her ear—a gesture I'd already noticed she did when she was thinking—and made notes in a little notebook she kept.

She was taking this seriously. Actually trying to do the work well, not just showing up for appearances.

I didn't want to respect that. It would be easier if she was just another rich girl playing at charity.

Saturday afternoon, I was fixing the bathroom sink when I heard her arrive. Mrs. Kowalski greeted her warmly, and I heard Grace laugh at something—a real laugh, not the polite kind. The sound carried through the walls.

I focused on the pipe fitting, trying to ignore the tight feeling in my chest.

The fitting was corroded worse than I'd thought. I'd need to replace the whole section. I was measuring the pipe when I heard running water where there shouldn't be any running water.

I swore and grabbed my wrench. The shut-off valve was stuck, and water was spraying from the pipe I'd just loosened. I wrestled with the valve, getting soaked in the process.

"Do you need help?"

I turned. Grace stood in the bathroom doorway, holding a flashlight.

"Valve's stuck," I said, putting my weight into turning it. Water sprayed my face. "Need to shut off the main."

"Where's that?"

"Basement." I was already moving, pushing past her. She followed.

The basement stairs were narrow and dark. I took them two at a time, Grace's footsteps lighter behind me. The main shut-off was in the back corner, behind boxes of old supplies. I cranked it hard, and the sound of rushing water overhead stopped.

"Okay," I said, breathing hard. "That should do it."

I turned to head back up and nearly ran into Grace. The basement was cramped, and she was standing on the narrow stairs holding the flashlight. This close, I could smell that flower scent again—perfume or soap or something that reminded me she didn't belong here.

"Sorry," she said, backing up the stairs. "I didn't mean to be in your way."

"It's fine." I followed her up, keeping distance between us.

Back in the bathroom, I surveyed the damage. Water pooled on the floor, but it could've been worse. I grabbed towels from the supply closet and started mopping up.

"Can I help?" Grace asked.

"I've got it."

But she grabbed towels anyway and crouched down next to me, soaking up water from the other side of the room. We worked in silence for a few minutes. I was hyper-aware of her presence—the way she tucked her skirt under her knees when she crouched, the sound of her breathing, the space between us that felt both too much and not enough.

"How long have you been fixing things?" she asked.

"Long enough."

"Mrs. Kowalski says you keep this whole place running."

I shrugged. "Things break. Somebody's got to fix them."

"Still, it's impressive. I wouldn't know where to start with a pipe like that."

"It's not complicated. Just takes practice."

She was quiet for a moment, wringing out her towel into the bucket. "How did you learn? From your father?"

The question felt too personal. I focused on the floor. "Yeah. He was a mechanic before the railroad."

"That must be nice. Having skills like that."

I glanced at her. She wasn't being condescending—her tone was genuine. But it still grated. She didn't know anything about my father, about watching him work himself to injury, about learning to fix things because we couldn't afford to pay someone else to do it.

"It's useful," I said shortly.

We finished mopping in silence. Grace carried the wet towels to the laundry bin while I went to get the new pipe fitting from my truck. When I came back, she was waiting in the bathroom.

"I can hold the flashlight again," she offered. "If you need it."

"There's enough light."

"Oh. Okay."

But she didn't leave. She stood there while I worked, watching me cut the old pipe section and fit the new one. I tried to ignore her, but it was like trying to ignore the sun. I was conscious of every movement I made, every breath.

"What made you start volunteering here?" she asked.

"Mrs. Kowalski needed help."

"But why here specifically? There must be other places."

I tightened the pipe fitting harder than necessary. "This is my neighborhood. These kids are like I was."

"Were you in programs like this when you were younger?"

"No. Might've helped if there had been."

She was quiet, processing that. I finished with the pipe and tested the connection. Solid. I stood and turned the water back on at the sink. No leaks.

"All fixed," I said, wiping my hands on my pants.

"You're really good at this."

I didn't know what to say to that. "It's just a pipe."

"Still. Thank you for fixing it so quickly. I'm sure Mrs. Kowalski appreciates everything you do."

There it was again—that genuine gratitude that felt like it came from someone who actually understood the value of work, not just performing politeness. It made something in my chest twist uncomfortably.

"You don't need to thank me for doing my job," I said, more curtly than I meant to.

Grace blinked, surprised. "I wasn't—I just meant—"

"I know what you meant." I picked up my toolbox. "But you don't owe me thanks. I fix things here because they need fixing, not for appreciation."

Her expression shifted—confusion mixed with something that might have been hurt. "I didn't mean to offend you."

"You didn't."

But I was already leaving, heading back toward the main room. Behind me, I heard her small sigh but I didn't turn around.

I found Mrs. Kowalski and told her the pipe was fixed but we'd need to watch for other corrosion in the system. She thanked me profusely and tried to get me to stay for dinner again. I declined and headed out to my truck.

Through the window, I could see Grace back with her reading group. She was smiling at something little Maria said, but there was a crease between her eyebrows that hadn't been there before.

I'd been rude to her. She'd just been trying to be nice, trying to make conversation, and I'd shut her down like she'd done something wrong.

But it was better this way.

Grace Mitchell was from a different world. She'd volunteer here for the summer, feel good about helping the poor kids on the wrong side of town, and then she'd leave. She'd go to college or get married to some boy from a good family and forget all about this place and these kids.

And definitely forget about the guy who fixed the pipes.

Which was exactly how it should be. There was no point in being friendly with her. No point in conversations that would make me start thinking she was different from other girls from her side of town. No point in noticing how she pushed her hair behind her ear when she was thinking, or how her laugh sounded genuine, or how she crouched down to talk to the kids at their level instead of talking down to them.

No point at all.

I started the truck and drove away, telling myself I was doing the right thing. The smart thing.

Telling myself that the uncomfortable twist in my chest when she'd looked hurt was nothing that mattered.

By Monday morning, loading freight cars in the rail yard, I'd almost convinced myself I believed it. Almost convinced myself that keeping Grace Mitchell at a distance was simple common sense and nothing more.

Almost.
