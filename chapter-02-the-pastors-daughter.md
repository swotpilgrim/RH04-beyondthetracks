# Chapter 2: The Pastor's Daughter

By the time the five o'clock whistle blew, I was covered in enough coal dust and grime that my own mother probably wouldn't recognize me. I clocked out, wiped my hands on my already-filthy work pants, and headed to my truck.

Most of the guys went straight home or to Murphy's Bar to wash the day down with cheap beer. I turned the opposite direction, toward the community center on Harrison Street.

I'd started going there about a year ago. Mrs. Kowalski, who ran the place on donations and determination, needed someone to fix things—busted toilets, cracked windows, the wheezing furnace. I had the tools and know-how from watching my father work. She couldn't pay me, but she fed me sometimes and let me feel useful in a way the rail yard never did.

The center was a squat brick building that had been a church once. Now it served the neighborhood kids—a place to go after school that wasn't the streets. Reading programs, homework help, supervised play. It wasn't much, but it was something.

I parked my truck in the gravel lot and grabbed my toolbox from the bed. Through the front windows, I could see kids inside already—the after-school crowd, loud and restless with the energy that came from being cooped up in classrooms all day.

The front door stuck like always. I shouldered it open and stepped into the main room. It smelled like old wood, chalk dust, and industrial cleaner. The floors were scuffed linoleum, the walls a cheerful yellow peeling in the corners. Mismatched tables and chairs filled the space. Kids' artwork covered every surface—crayon drawings of houses and families and dogs.

"Tommy!" Mrs. Kowalski bustled over, a short, round Polish woman in her sixties who had more energy than men half her age. "The light in the reading corner went out again. Can you look at it?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She beamed. Mrs. Kowalski had this way of making you feel like fixing a light bulb was the most important thing you could possibly do with your afternoon. "You're a blessing. Oh!" She caught my arm as I headed toward the supply closet. "I should tell you—we have a new volunteer starting today. She'll be helping with the reading program."

"Okay."

"She's Pastor Mitchell's daughter. Very sweet girl. Very dedicated."

I kept my expression neutral. Pastor Mitchell ran the big white church on the other side of town, the one with stained glass windows and a congregation full of the right kind of people. I'd never been inside, never would be. Churches like that weren't for families like mine.

"She should be here any minute," Mrs. Kowalski continued. "I know the children will love her."

I headed to the supply closet for the stepladder. The reading corner was on the far side, marked off by a braided rug and low bookshelves. The overhead light had been flickering for weeks. I'd replaced the bulb twice—the problem was probably the wiring.

I set up the ladder and climbed, unscrewing the glass cover. A couple of kids looked up from their homework but quickly lost interest. I was part of the furniture here—the guy who fixed stuff, who broke up fights, who sometimes shot basketball with them.

The wiring looked corroded. I'd have to replace the whole fixture eventually, but for now I could clean the connections and buy us some time. I was elbow-deep in the work when I heard Mrs. Kowalski's voice again, bright with welcome.

"Grace! Come in, come in!"

I didn't look down. Wasn't my business who she was greeting. But I heard the door unstick, heard footsteps—lighter, more hesitant than the kids' usual stomping.

"Thank you so much for having me, Mrs. Kowalski." The voice was soft, well-modulated. The kind of voice that came from a good home with good manners. "I'm excited to help."

"We're thrilled to have you. Let me show you around."

I focused on the wiring, trying to ignore the conversation below. But sound carried in the big room, and I couldn't help hearing Mrs. Kowalski's tour—here's where we do homework help, here's the craft supplies, here's the reading corner where you'll be working.

"Oh, don't mind Tommy up there," Mrs. Kowalski said, and I felt both of them looking at me. "He's fixing our light. Tommy does all our repairs. We'd fall apart without him."

I glanced down then, couldn't help it.

The girl standing next to Mrs. Kowalski was maybe seventeen, wearing a yellow summer dress, modest and neat. Her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail. Pretty without being showy, clean and fresh and completely out of place in this rundown building.

Grace Mitchell. I'd never met her, but I'd seen her at a distance—in her father's sedan, outside the drugstore with girls from the good families. She was the kind of girl who lived on the other side of the tracks in every way that mattered.

Our eyes met for a second. Hers were brown, uncertain but trying not to show it. I looked away first, back to the wiring.

"Tommy, this is Grace Mitchell," Mrs. Kowalski called up. "Grace, this is Tommy Keane. He's been volunteering here for about a year now."

I climbed down the ladder, wiping my grimy hands on my pants even though it didn't help. Up close, she was even more out of place—her dress was pressed, her shoes had to be new, and she smelled like something floral that definitely didn't come from this neighborhood.

"It's nice to meet you," she said, extending her hand.

I looked at my filthy hands, then at her clean one. "Better not," I said. "I'm covered in coal dust."

"Oh." She pulled her hand back, but she smiled like she wasn't bothered. "Well, it's still nice to meet you. Mrs. Kowalski told me how much you do for the center. Thank you for that."

I shrugged. "Just fixing things that break."

"Still. It's important work."

I didn't know what to say to that. Girls like Grace Mitchell didn't usually notice work like mine, much less call it important. I mumbled something that might have been "thanks" and turned back to the ladder.

"Let me show you the reading materials," Mrs. Kowalski said, guiding Grace away. I climbed back up, grateful for the excuse to not make conversation.

But I could still hear them. Grace asked questions—what age groups would she work with, what reading levels, what materials were available. Smart questions, the kind that showed she was actually thinking about how to do this job well, not just showing up to feel good about herself.

The kids started filtering over, curious about the new person. Mrs. Kowalski introduced Grace to a handful of them—Danny Porter, who was twelve and could barely read despite being smart as a whip; little Maria Rodriguez, eight years old with big eyes and bigger dreams; the Carter twins, rowdy ten-year-old boys who wore Mrs. Kowalski out on a good day.

I pretended to focus on the light fixture, but I was watching Grace in my peripheral vision. She crouched down to talk to the kids at their level, didn't talk down to them the way some volunteers did. When Danny mumbled his name without meeting her eyes, she didn't push. When the Carter twins started showing off, trying to get her attention with roughhousing, she laughed but didn't encourage it.

Maybe she'd be okay. Maybe she actually cared, wasn't just here to pad her college applications or feel charitable for a few weeks before getting bored.

I finished with the light fixture and climbed down. The connection would hold for a while, at least. I folded up the ladder and carried it back to the supply closet, then grabbed my toolbox.

"All fixed?" Mrs. Kowalski asked.

"For now. The whole fixture needs replacing eventually, but this'll do."

"You're wonderful. Stay for dinner? I made pierogies."

My stomach growled at the thought. Ma wouldn't have anything ready for hours yet, and Mrs. Kowalski's cooking was better than anything we ate at home. But I looked at Grace, still surrounded by curious kids, still smiling that clean, bright smile, and something in me twisted.

"Can't tonight. Got stuff to do at home."

Mrs. Kowalski looked disappointed but nodded. "Next time then."

I headed for the door, but Grace's voice stopped me.

"Thank you again, Tommy. For fixing the light."

I glanced back. She was still crouched next to little Maria, but she'd turned to look at me. There was something genuine in her expression, something that seemed real and not just polite.

"Yeah," I said. "Sure."

Outside, I threw my toolbox in the truck bed harder than necessary. The sun was starting to sink, painting the sky orange and pink. In a couple of hours, I'd head to bed and do it all again tomorrow—rail yard, community center, home. The same routine day after day.

I climbed into the truck and sat there for a minute, hands on the wheel. Through the window, I could see Grace inside, laughing at something one of the kids said. Her whole face lit up when she laughed, unselfconscious and bright.

I started the engine.

She was Pastor Mitchell's daughter. She lived on the right side of the tracks in a nice house with parents who went to church every Sunday and had never wondered where their next meal was coming from. She wore clean dresses and new shoes and probably had plans to go to college somewhere far from Copper Ridge.

I was a railroad worker who'd dropped out of school at sixteen. My hands were permanently stained with coal dust. I lived in a house where the paint was peeling and the windows shook when trains went by. I had no future beyond loading freight cars until my back gave out like my father's.

Those were facts. Simple, unchangeable facts.

Which meant the smart thing to do was forget Grace Mitchell existed. She'd volunteer here for a few weeks, maybe the whole summer if she was really dedicated, and then she'd go back to her life on the right side of town. Our paths had crossed for a moment, but that's all it was. A moment.

I put the truck in gear and drove home, already working on forgetting the way her smile lit up the whole room. Already trying not to think about how she'd called my work important.

By the time I pulled up to my house, I'd almost convinced myself I'd succeeded.

Almost.
