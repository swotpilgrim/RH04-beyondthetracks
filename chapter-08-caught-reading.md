# Chapter 8: Caught Reading

I'd kept the poetry reading secret from everyone. Not just mostly secret—completely secret.

My father would laugh if he knew. Mock me for putting on airs, for thinking I was better than what I was. The guys at the rail yard would razz me endlessly. Even Mrs. Kowalski, kind as she was, might look at me differently. Poetry wasn't for guys like me. It was for college students and teachers and people who had time for things that didn't pay the bills.

So I read alone. In my truck during lunch breaks. Late at night in my room. And sometimes, when the center was quiet, in the small storage room where Mrs. Kowalski let me keep my tools.

Thursday afternoon, first week of July. The heat wave had broken overnight, leaving the air cooler and clean-feeling. The center was quiet—just a handful of kids doing homework in the main room. Grace was helping Danny with arithmetic at one of the tables. Mrs. Kowalski was in her office working on grant applications, trying to scrape together funding to keep the place open.

I'd finished fixing the temperamental water fountain and didn't have anything else urgent to do. So I slipped into the storage room, closed the door most of the way, and sat on the overturned wooden crate I used as a stool when I worked in here.

From my toolbox, I pulled out *Leaves of Grass*. The cover was more worn now than when I'd stolen it six months ago. The spine was cracked from re-reading. Some pages had corners turned down at passages that hit me particularly hard.

I opened to "Song of Myself" and started reading where I'd left off.

*Do I contradict myself?*
*Very well then I contradict myself,*
*(I am large, I contain multitudes.)*

The words settled into me like they always did. Whitman wrote about being complex, about containing contradictions. About being more than one thing. More than what people expected.

I could be a railroad worker and love poetry. Could be rough around the edges and still feel things deeply. Could be from the wrong side of the tracks and want more than the life laid out for me.

The idea was beautiful. Probably impossible, but beautiful.

I kept reading, absorbed in Whitman's barbaric yawp, his celebration of self, his insistence that every person contained multitudes worth celebrating.

"Is that Whitman?"

I jumped so hard I nearly dropped the book. My heart slammed into my throat as I looked up.

Grace stood in the doorway.

Instinct made me try to hide the book—shove it behind my back, pretend it wasn't there. But I was sitting down and she was three feet away and we both knew what I'd been doing.

I waited for the mockery. Or worse, the condescending surprise. *Oh, how sweet, the railroad worker reads poetry.*

Instead, Grace's whole face lit up.

"I love Whitman!" She stepped into the room, her expression bright with genuine delight. "Is that *Leaves of Grass*?"

I stared at her, completely thrown. "Yeah."

"I haven't read that since English class last year. Can I...?" She gestured to the paint can near where I sat.

"I guess."

She settled onto the paint can like it was the most natural thing in the world, sitting in a storage room with the maintenance guy who'd just been caught reading poetry.

My defenses went up immediately. "I was just—"

"'I am large, I contain multitudes,'" Grace quoted softly. "That's from 'Song of Myself,' right?"

I nodded, still waiting for the catch. For the moment when this turned into mockery or pity.

"What do you think it means?" she asked. "The multitudes part?"

"What?"

"When you read it, what do you think Whitman's saying?"

She was serious. Actually asking my opinion on poetry like it mattered what I thought.

"I..." I looked down at the book in my hands. "I think he means people are more complicated than they seem. That you can be lots of things at once. Contradictory things. And that's okay."

Grace nodded slowly. "I think so too. My English teacher said it was about individualism and the American spirit, but I always thought it was more personal than that. More about not letting people put you in a box."

"Yeah." The word came out rough. "Yeah, exactly."

She smiled. "Can I see it?"

I handed her the book, watched her run her fingers over the worn cover.

"You've read this a lot," she observed.

"Few times."

"Which poems do you like best?"

"'Song of the Open Road.' And this one—'Song of Myself.'"

"Those are good ones. I always liked 'I Sing the Body Electric.' The way he writes about human dignity, about everyone being worthy of celebration." She flipped through the pages carefully. "Where did you get this?"

The honest answer would be confessing I'd stolen it. I settled for a partial truth. "The library."

"Do you read a lot of poetry?"

"When I can."

"Who else do you like?"

This was surreal. Grace Mitchell, pastor's daughter, sitting in a dusty storage room asking me about poetry like we were classmates discussing homework. Like this was normal.

"Frost," I said hesitantly. "Robert Frost. 'The Road Not Taken.' And some Sandburg—'Chicago.'"

"I love Frost. Have you read 'Mending Wall'? 'Good fences make good neighbors'?"

"Yeah. Though I always thought he was being sarcastic."

Grace's eyes brightened. "Yes! That's exactly what I thought, but my teacher said I was reading too much into it. But the whole poem is about how the wall is stupid and unnecessary."

"'Before I built a wall I'd ask to know what I was walling in or walling out,'" I quoted.

"And to whom I was like to give offense,'" Grace finished. She was grinning now. "See? He's questioning the whole idea of walls and fences."

I found myself smiling back. "Yeah."

We sat there for a moment, just looking at each other. Grace in her blue summer dress, sitting on a paint can in a storage room. Me in my work clothes, still holding Whitman's words between us.

"Why do you keep it secret?" she asked quietly.

The question hit deeper than expected. "Because guys like me aren't supposed to care about poetry."

"Says who?"

"Everyone. My father. The guys at the yard. Pretty much everyone who knows me."

"I know you. And I don't think that."

"You've known me for a month."

"So? I've known you long enough to see you're smart and thoughtful and care about things that matter. That seems exactly like someone who'd read poetry."

I didn't know what to say to that. Part of me wanted to believe her. Part of me knew she didn't understand—couldn't understand—what it was like to be from my side of town, where showing that you cared about anything beyond work and survival was seen as weak or pretentious.

"It's different for you," I said finally.

"Because I'm from the right side of the tracks?"

"Because people expect more from you. You're supposed to be educated and cultured. Me, I'm supposed to load freight and drink beer and not think too hard about anything."

Grace was quiet for a moment, looking at the book in her hands. "That's not fair."

"Maybe not. But it's how it is."

"Then how it is shouldn't be."

The conviction in her voice surprised me. Like she was personally offended by the unfairness of it, not just making sympathetic noises.

"Whitman would agree with you," I said.

"What do you mean?"

"All his stuff about equality. About every person being worthy, being complex, containing multitudes. He wouldn't think it was right that where you're from decides what you're allowed to care about."

"Exactly." Grace handed the book back to me. "So maybe stop caring what other people think you're supposed to be. Read what you want to read."

"Easy to say."

"I know. But still true."

From the main room, Mrs. Kowalski's voice called out. "Grace? Danny needs help with the next problem."

Grace stood, brushed dust off her dress. "I should go."

"Yeah."

She paused at the door, looked back at me. "Thank you for sharing this with me. And... I won't tell anyone. If you don't want me to."

"I don't."

"Then I won't. But for what it's worth, I don't think you should be ashamed of it. Reading poetry, thinking about things. It makes you more interesting, not less."

She slipped out before I could respond.

I sat there alone in the storage room, still holding *Leaves of Grass*, my heart doing something complicated in my chest.

Grace had caught me reading poetry. Had seen the secret thing I kept hidden from everyone. And instead of laughing or being condescending or treating it like a cute quirk, she'd engaged with it. Really engaged. Quoted Whitman back to me. Discussed Frost like my interpretation mattered as much as her English teacher's.

She'd seen something I kept hidden, and she hadn't rejected it.

Worse—she'd understood it.

That understanding felt more dangerous than anything that had come before. Because it wasn't just that Grace was pretty, or kind, or from a different world. It was that she saw past the surface to parts of me I didn't show anyone, and she didn't run away.

She moved closer.

I wrapped the book carefully and tucked it back in my toolbox. My hands were shaking slightly—adrenaline from being caught, maybe, or something else I didn't want to name.

Through the partially open door, I could hear Grace helping Danny with his arithmetic. Her voice was patient, encouraging. The same voice that had just asked me about Walt Whitman like it was the most natural conversation in the world.

I should've felt relieved that she'd promised not to tell anyone. And I was relieved. But underneath the relief was something more complicated.

Grace Mitchell knew I read poetry now. Had talked to me about it like we were equals, like my thoughts on Whitman were as valid as anyone's. Had looked at me like this secret thing made me more interesting instead of ridiculous.

Had looked at me like she saw me. Really saw me.

And I'd let her. I'd quoted Frost and discussed Whitman and let her into this private part of myself I'd never shown anyone.

The walls I'd been trying to rebuild between us had just developed another crack.

A big one.

I picked up my toolbox and headed back into the main room, back to work, back to being the guy who fixed things and didn't show what he was feeling.

But when I glanced at Grace helping Danny, she looked up and caught my eye. And smiled.

Small. Private. Like we shared a secret now.

And God help me, I smiled back.
