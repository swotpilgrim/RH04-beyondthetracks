# Chapter 1: Wrong Side of Everything

The train whistle woke me at five-fifteen, same as always. I lay there in the dark listening to the freight rumble past, shaking the windows of our small house like it did every morning. Some people probably got used to that sound, learned to sleep through it. Not me. Four years of working the rail yard and I still heard every train that passed through Copper Ridge.

I swung my legs out of bed, feet hitting the cold floor. June mornings in Ohio still had that chill before the sun burned it off. Through the thin wall, I could hear my father already moving around in the kitchen. Frank Keane never slept past five anymore, not since his back went out two years ago. Said the pain woke him. I figured bitterness did just as good a job.

I pulled on my work clothes—denim pants stained with oil and coal dust that never washed out, white undershirt, button-up shirt. My work boots were heavy and scarred from four years of hard use. Mary's room across the hall was smaller than mine. She was fourteen and smarter than anyone on this side of town, but nobody cared about that. Smart didn't matter when you were a Keane.

Coffee was brewing when I reached the kitchen.

Pa was at the table, hands wrapped around his mug, staring at nothing. He looked older than forty-five, face lined deep and shoulders permanently hunched from years of loading freight before his injury. Now he did light maintenance work at the yard, the kind of job they gave to men whose bodies gave out before their time.

"Another day of the same," he said without looking at me.

"Yes, sir."

Ma stood at the stove, her back to us, making eggs and toast. Her hair was already pinned up, and she was dressed for the day even though it was barely dawn. She took in laundry from families on the other side of town—the good side—and she'd be at it from sunup to sundown. Her hands were raw from lye soap and hot water.

"Sit down, Tommy. Eat something."

I sat. Ma set a plate in front of me without meeting my eyes. We didn't talk much in the mornings. Pa would go to the yard for his maintenance shift. Ma would wash other people's clothes. I'd load freight cars. Mary would go to school where teachers looked through her like she was invisible.

I ate fast. Ma's cooking was plain but filling, and I'd need the fuel for the yard.

"See you tonight," I said, grabbing my jacket from the hook by the door.

Ma nodded. Pa grunted something that might have been goodbye. I stepped out into the predawn gray.

Our house sat three streets from the tracks. The houses were small, close together, painted in colors that had faded to nearly nothing. Some folks kept their yards neat. Others had given up. We were somewhere in between.

I fired up my truck—a beat-up Ford. The engine coughed and caught, and I headed toward Joe's Diner.

The diner sat on the corner of Fifth and Harrison, right in the heart of our neighborhood. It was the kind of place where railroad workers and factory hands ate—cheap food, strong coffee, no pretense. The chrome trim had tarnished and the red vinyl seats were patched with tape, but it was always full before the morning shifts.

Inside, the air smelled like bacon grease and coffee. The jukebox in the corner sat silent this early, but it would be playing Chuck Berry or Elvis by lunch. I slid onto a stool at the counter. Rita, who'd been working here longer than I'd been alive, poured me coffee without asking.

"Morning, Tommy."

"Morning."

The usual crew was scattered around—Mac and Jimmy from the yard, old Pete from the switching station. They were talking rough, the way men do.

"You see that blonde at Murphy's Saturday night?" Jimmy was saying.

"Your wife find out you were looking, she'd give you hell," Mac shot back.

Laughter, rough and easy. I listened without joining in. They were good men mostly, doing hard work for low pay, making jokes to forget about it.

"Tommy, you coming out Saturday?" Mac called over. "Eddie said he's got a card game going."

"Maybe." I wouldn't. Eddie Russo and his crew were heading nowhere fast, and I'd figured that out about a year ago. But saying no outright would raise questions I didn't want to answer.

I finished my coffee, left two bits on the counter, and headed out. The sun was breaking over the horizon, painting everything gold and pink.

The railroad yard sprawled across the east side of town. The office building was brick and imposing. The freight platforms stretched for what seemed like miles. During the day, the yard was chaos—trains arriving and departing, workers loading and unloading, whistles and shouts and metal screeching.

I clocked in at six sharp. The foreman, a thick-necked man named Hutchins, was already barking orders.

"Keane! Platform three. We got two cars need loading by nine."

"Yes, sir."

I grabbed my gloves and headed to platform three. This was my life—lifting crates and barrels and boxes, loading them into cars bound for Chicago or Cleveland or Pittsburgh. My back would ache by noon. Coal dust and oil would work into my skin until I was gray with it.

Thirty-eight dollars a week. I gave most to Ma, kept enough for gas. That's what you did when you were a Keane—worked hard, didn't complain, didn't expect anything better.

The morning passed in a blur of lifting, hauling, stacking. The sun climbed higher, and the heat built. By ten o'clock I was sweating through my shirt. By noon my shoulders burned. The work didn't leave much breath for conversation.

At twelve-thirty, the whistle blew for lunch break. I grabbed the sandwich I'd packed—leftover meatloaf between two slices of bread—and headed to my truck.

This was the part of the day I looked forward to and dreaded in equal measure.

I climbed into the cab and shut the door. From the glove box, I pulled out a book wrapped in brown paper. *Leaves of Grass* by Walt Whitman.

I'd stolen it from the library six months ago. Not borrowed—stolen, because I didn't have a library card and didn't want to explain why a guy like me wanted poetry. Every few weeks I'd slip another book from the shelves, careful no one saw.

I unwrapped the book carefully and opened to where I'd left off. "Song of the Open Road."

*Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,*
*Healthy, free, the world before me,*
*The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.*

The words hit me hard, same as always. Whitman wrote about freedom, about choice, about the open road stretching out with infinite possibilities. I sat in a freight yard doing the same work my father had done and his father before him, reading about choosing your own path.

I knew it was stupid. Poetry wouldn't change anything. I'd still be here tomorrow, loading freight cars, breathing coal dust. But for these thirty minutes, I could pretend there was something more.

I read slowly, letting the words settle. Whitman talked about containing multitudes, about being large and contradicting yourself. I wondered what that would feel like—to be that free, that uncontained.

A knock on the truck window made me jump. I slammed the book shut and shoved it under the seat, heart pounding.

Jimmy stood outside, grinning. "Break's almost over. You sleeping in there?"

"Just resting my eyes."

"Sure." He walked off, already forgetting about me.

I sat there a moment longer, breathing hard. That was too close. If the guys found out I read poetry—if my father found out—I'd never hear the end of it. They'd laugh, or worse, think I was putting on airs.

I wrapped the book carefully and tucked it back in the glove box.

The afternoon was more of the same. Lift, carry, stack. My muscles settled into the rhythm, and my mind drifted. That's how you survived this work—you let your body do the job while your brain went somewhere else. I thought about Whitman's words, about open roads. About trains heading somewhere that wasn't here.

At five o'clock, the whistle blew for end of shift. I was covered in grime and sweat, my hands aching despite the gloves. I clocked out, collected my truck from the lot, and headed home.

The route took me past the railroad tracks that cut through the center of Copper Ridge. On my side: small houses, corner stores with bars on the windows, the community center with its peeling paint. On the other side: neat lawns, two-story homes with porches, the white church with its tall steeple, shops with cheerful awnings.

The tracks weren't just steel and wood. They were a line you didn't cross. You could see it but you stayed on your side, knew your place. Good families lived over there. Families like mine lived over here. That's how it had always been. That's how it would stay.

I drove past the tracks without looking too long at the other side. Wanting what you couldn't have was pointless.

Back home, Ma was hanging laundry in the yard. Pa sat on the porch, drinking beer in the fading light. Mary was inside doing homework at the kitchen table, her books spread out in the lamplight.

I parked the truck and walked up the steps. Tomorrow I'd wake at five-fifteen to the sound of another train. I'd go to the yard and load more freight cars. I'd hide my poetry book during lunch and pretend I wasn't hungry for something more than this.

Because this was my life. This was what Keanes did. We worked the railroad. We stayed on our side of the tracks. We didn't dream about open roads or choosing our own paths.

I kicked off my boots at the door and headed inside, already tired for tomorrow.
