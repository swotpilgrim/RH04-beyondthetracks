# Chapter 22: Tommy's Belief Confirmed

Early September settled over Copper Ridge like a weight. Cooler mornings that should have felt like relief just felt like endings.

I worked. That's all I did. Work and sleep and work again, an endless loop keeping me too tired to feel.

Double shifts weren't enough. I started showing up early, staying late. The foreman stopped questioning it, just nodded when I appeared in pre-dawn darkness.

My body was paying for it. Calluses on calluses, knuckles swollen from gripping freight. My back ached constantly. I'd caught myself limping, favoring my right knee.

Didn't matter. Physical pain was preferable to thinking.

At home, I barely spoke. Came through the door after dark, ate whatever Ma had left warming on the stove, went to my room. She'd try to engage me in conversation sometimes, ask about my day, if I was feeling all right.

I'd answer in monosyllables until she gave up.

Thursday evening, I made the mistake of sitting on the porch for a few minutes before heading to bed. Just needed air, needed to see something other than the four walls of my room.

Frank was already there, bottle in hand, staring at nothing.

We sat in silence for a while. The September night was cool enough to be almost pleasant, crickets singing their last songs before fall silenced them. In the distance, a train whistle called.

"You're turning into me," Frank said finally.

I didn't respond.

"Working yourself to death for nothing. Coming home too tired to live. Going through the motions." He took a long drink. "No future beyond this."

"Maybe you're right."

"Course I'm right." Another drink. "Been telling you that for years. Keane men don't amount to much. We work the railroad until our backs break, then we work some more until we die. That's it. That's the whole story."

I should have gone inside. Should have walked away from his bitterness before it infected me more than it already had.

But I didn't move.

"That girl," Frank said. "The pastor's daughter. She was your chance at something different. You know that, right?"

"There was no chance. There was never any chance."

"Maybe not. But you believed there was for a while. Saw it on your face this summer. You thought maybe you could be more than this." He gestured vaguely at the house, the neighborhood, the tracks gleaming in the distance. "More than me."

"I was wrong."

"Yeah. You were." Frank's agreement hit harder than any criticism. "Wrong side of the tracks boys don't get the nice girls. Don't get the good lives. We stay where we belong, do the work nobody else wants, and die forgotten. Sooner you accept that, sooner you can stop hurting."

"I have accepted it."

"Have you? Because you're working yourself to death trying to outrun it." He looked at me directly, eyes clearer than they should have been with that much whiskey in him. "But you can't outrun what you are, Tommy. I tried. Your grandfather tried. We all tried. Doesn't work. You are what you are."

I stood abruptly. "I'm going to bed."

"Run away if you want. Won't change anything." Frank turned back to his bottle. "You're still my son. Still from this neighborhood. Still destined for exactly what I got. Nothing."

I went inside before I could say something I'd regret. Or worse—before I could agree with him out loud.

Because he was right. Everything he'd said was right.

I was turning into him. Working myself to death, bitter and resigned, accepting limitations everyone else had set for me.

And maybe that was all I'd ever been destined for.

Friday afternoon, Marty cornered me at Joe's Diner.

I'd stopped for coffee before heading home, planning to drink it fast and leave. But Marty slid into the booth across from me before I could escape.

"You look like hell," he observed.

"Thanks."

"I'm serious, Tommy. You're working yourself to death. Everyone at the yard's noticed."

"Not your problem."

"The hell it isn't. You're my friend." Marty's jaw was set in that stubborn way that meant he wasn't letting this go. "And friends don't watch friends destroy themselves without saying something."

"I'm not destroying myself. I'm working. Supporting my family. Being useful." I took a scalding sip of coffee. "What's wrong with that?"

"Nothing's wrong with honest work. But this isn't about work. This is about running. This is about..." He paused, lowered his voice. "This is about that girl. About giving up."

"There's nothing to give up on."

"You're acting like somebody died."

The words hit something in my chest. "Maybe somebody did."

"Who?"

"The version of me that thought he could be more than this." I set down the coffee cup carefully. "The idiot who thought a pastor's daughter could care about a railroad worker. The fool who believed he deserved something better than what he was born to."

"Tommy—"

"You want to know who told me I was nothing, Marty? Who convinced me I'd never amount to anything?" I counted on my fingers. "My father. My teachers. The town gossips. Pastor Mitchell. Eddie Russo. Margaret Walsh. The church ladies. Your girlfriend's sister, probably. Hell, even Danny looked at me with disappointment when I stopped going to the center. You know what they all have in common? They're all right."

"That's not—"

"It is. They're right. I'm rough, limited, good for loading freight and nothing else. I got into a public fight and proved I'm violent. I don't have education or prospects or any reason to think I could be more. Grace was a beautiful dream, but dreams don't change reality."

"So that's it? You're just giving up? Accepting their verdict?"

"I'm being realistic." I met his eyes. "There's a difference."

"No, there isn't." Marty's voice was hard. "You're feeling sorry for yourself. Wallowing in it. Using everyone else's opinions as an excuse not to try."

"Maybe I am. So what?" Anger flared hot in my chest. "Maybe I'm tired of trying. Tired of hoping for things I can't have. Tired of wanting more when more isn't available to guys like me. Maybe accepting reality is smarter than fighting it."

"Fighting it is called living, Tommy."

"No. Accepting it is called living. Fighting it is called delusion." I stood, throwing coins on the table for the coffee. "I was deluded this summer. Thought I could be someone I'm not. Thought I deserved things I don't. Now I know better."

"Tommy, wait—"

But I was already walking out, Marty's frustrated curse following me into the September afternoon.

He was wrong. I wasn't giving up. I was accepting reality. There was a difference, no matter what he thought.

Wasn't there?

Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Kowalski showed up at the rail yard again.

I saw her Buick pull up and considered hiding behind a freight car until she left. But she'd already spotted me, was making her careful way across the yard.

"Tommy." She reached me slightly out of breath. "We need to talk."

"I'm working."

"It's your lunch break. I checked." She gestured to a shaded area near the fence. "Five minutes."

I followed reluctantly, already knowing what this was about.

"The center needs you," she said without preamble. "The kids need you. Danny's struggling without someone to look up to. Eddie's been circling again, and I can't be everywhere at once."

"You're doing fine."

"I'm not. We're barely holding on. And those kids—they're not just losing a volunteer. They're losing someone who showed them they could be more than their circumstances."

"They can find that somewhere else."

"From who?" Mrs. Kowalski's voice was sharp. "Who else in that neighborhood is showing them anything besides resignation? Who's telling them they're worth something?"

"I'm not the right person for that. You saw the fight. I proved I'm exactly what everyone thinks."

"You proved you care enough to protect them. Even when it costs you."

"I proved I'm violent and rough and from the wrong side of the tracks." The words tasted like ash. "Pastor Mitchell was right about me. Eddie was right. They're all right."

Mrs. Kowalski looked at me for a long moment, her weathered face sad. "You used to fight back against that kind of thinking. What happened?"

"I got realistic."

"You gave up." She shook her head. "I thought you were better than this resignation, Tommy. Thought you understood that where you come from doesn't have to determine where you go. I was wrong about you."

She walked away, leaving me standing there with her disappointment hanging heavy in the air.

Her words echoed Marty's. Danny's. Even Frank's, in a twisted way.

Everyone seemed to think I was giving up, surrendering, choosing resignation over fight.

But they were wrong. I wasn't giving up. I was accepting reality.

The reality that Grace was gone. That I'd blown my one chance by being exactly what everyone expected—violent, rough, wrong.

The reality that I was a Keane, from the wrong side of the tracks, destined for the railroad and nothing more.

The reality that for one brief summer, I'd deluded myself into thinking I could be different. Someone worthy of Grace Mitchell.

Didn't matter now.

That night, I lay in my narrow bed listening to the trains. The sound had been the background of my entire life—freight trains passing through, carrying goods and people to places I'd never see. The rhythm was as familiar as my own heartbeat.

Once, for a few weeks, I'd let myself imagine boarding one of those trains. Going somewhere else, being someone else. Grace had made me feel like that was possible.

But Grace had been wrong about me.

Everyone else had been right.

I was Tommy Keane. Railroad worker. Wrong side of the tracks. Rough kid with a temper and no prospects.

The summer with Grace had been an aberration. A fantasy. A beautiful, impossible dream that had felt real for a while.

But dreams end when you wake up.

And I was awake now. Fully awake. Seeing clearly for the first time in months.

I was what I'd always been. What I'd always be.

And accepting that truth was the only way to survive it.

Even if acceptance felt like dying.

Even if realistic felt like giving up.

Even if everyone was right about me and that knowledge sat in my chest like a stone.

The trains whistled in the distance. Heading elsewhere. Leaving Copper Ridge behind.

I'd never be on one of them.

I'd stay here. Work the railroad. Turn into my father. Die in the same place I was born.

That was reality.

That was my life.

And I'd finally accepted it.

Completely.

Finally.

Forever.
