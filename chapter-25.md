# Chapter 25: Aftermath

The revival meeting dissolved into chaos.

People approached Grace—some supportive, some critical. Mrs. Henderson reached for her hand kindly. But Mr. Walsh stood stiff and disapproving next to his wife.

"That was completely inappropriate," Margaret Walsh's voice carried. "Sarah, speaking to the congregation like that—accusing us of hypocrisy—it's disrespectful!"

"It was honest," Sarah Mitchell said firmly. "Maybe we needed to hear it."

"The girl called us all hypocrites!"

"Did she lie?" Sarah asked.

Mrs. Walsh made an indignant noise and stalked off, others following. The congregation fractured—those scandalized, those thoughtful, those cautiously supportive.

And in the middle sat Grace, shaking and pale and probably terrified.

I should go to her.

But my feet wouldn't move. Every eye in Copper Ridge would be on us. Every judgment would solidify the moment I approached her.

Coward, I thought. She was brave enough to stand up there, and you can't walk across a park.

Pastor Mitchell descended from the stage, moving toward Grace. His face was complicated—pride warring with concern, love fighting with pain.

What would he say to her?

I couldn't watch. Couldn't sit here paralyzed.

I stood abruptly.

"Where are you going?" Marty asked.

"I need air."

I pushed past my mother's concerned look, past the clusters discussing Grace's speech. Made it to the parking lot before I could breathe again.

I leaned against my truck, pressing my palms against cool metal, trying to ground myself.

Grace had done that. Really done that.

Had stood in front of everyone and spoken truth. Defended me. Publicly. Irreversibly.

My hands were shaking.

What did this mean? What happened now?

"Tommy."

I spun around.

Grace stood ten feet away, breathless. Her face tear-stained, eyes red, but her jaw set with determination.

Behind her, people watched from the park. Her mother. The congregation. Everyone seeing the pastor's daughter approach the rough boy.

"Grace." My voice came out rough. "You shouldn't—everyone's watching."

"I don't care." She took a step closer. "Did you hear? The speech?"

"Everyone heard. Pretty sure they heard you in the next county." I tried for humor but it fell flat. "Yeah. I heard."

"I meant every word."

The simple statement hit harder than anything she'd said on that stage. Standing here, looking directly at me, no audience to perform for—just truth.

"You didn't have to do that," I said. "You just made everything harder for yourself. Your father, the church ladies, the whole town—they're going to—"

"I know what they're going to do. I knew before I stood up." Grace stepped closer again, close enough now that I could see her trembling. "I couldn't stay quiet anymore, Tommy. Couldn't keep performing. Couldn't pretend I believed their prejudice was somehow righteous just because they dressed it up in concern."

"Your father's going to be furious."

"Maybe. Probably." She wrapped her arms around herself. "But I'm done letting fear of his anger control my choices. Done letting other people decide who I can care about."

The word care hung between us, weighted with everything we weren't saying.

"Grace." I pushed away from the truck, needing her to understand. "You don't know what you're asking for. Being... whatever this is... with me means people will talk. Judge you. Your family will be upset. You'll be associated with the wrong neighborhood, the wrong kind of people. It's not—"

"Being without you has been worse."

The words stopped me cold.

"These past few weeks," Grace continued, voice breaking, "I've been miserable. Going through motions. Playing the perfect daughter, attending church functions, pretending I was fine. But I wasn't fine. I was hollow."

She looked up at me, tears spilling over again.

"I thought I was doing the right thing. Obeying my father, accepting his authority, staying where I belonged. But it felt like dying, Tommy. Like losing the only thing that had made me feel real in years."

"Grace—"

"I love my father. I respect him. But he's wrong about you. Wrong about judgment being the same as wisdom. Wrong about thinking love only works inside approved categories." She stepped closer, close enough to touch if I reached out. "And I'm done agreeing with him just because it's easier than standing up for what I believe."

Behind her, more people had gathered at the edge of the parking lot. Watching. Always watching.

"People are staring," I said.

"Let them." Grace's chin lifted. "Let them see. Let them talk. I'm done hiding. Done pretending I don't..." She paused, gathered courage. "Done pretending I don't care about you."

My heart was hammering so hard I could barely hear my own thoughts over it.

"I'm terrified," I admitted, the words spilling out. "Terrified of disappointing you. Of being exactly what everyone warned you about—rough, limited, wrong for you. Of proving your father right and breaking your heart."

"You won't."

"You don't know that. I'm still the guy who got into a public fight. Still from the wrong neighborhood with no prospects and a temper and—"

"And you're also thoughtful and kind and good with kids and you read poetry and you see people, Tommy." Grace did reach out then, her hand finding mine. "You see past surfaces to who people really are. That's rare. That's valuable. That's why I—"

She stopped, but her hand was warm in mine and her eyes were saying what she couldn't.

Around us, the whispers grew louder. I could see Mrs. Walsh's scandalized face from here. Could see other congregation members pointing, talking, judging.

Could also see Ma, standing with her hand pressed to her heart, smiling through tears.

Could see Marty giving me a thumbs up.

Could see Sarah Mitchell watching her daughter with pride and pain and love all mixed together.

"Your mom's watching," I said quietly.

Grace glanced back, saw her mother, turned back to me. "She'll understand. Eventually. She already started to—that's why she was asking about you at the center."

"And your father?"

"I don't know." Grace's voice was small. "He looked... I don't know. But I can't base my choices on his approval anymore. Can't let fear of disappointing him keep me from living honestly."

I looked down at our joined hands. Hers pale and soft, mine rough and dark with work stains. The contrast said everything about why this was impossible.

And nothing about why it felt right anyway.

"I don't have anything to offer you," I said. "No money, no prospects, no respectable future. I work at the rail yard loading freight. I live in a two-room house on the wrong side of the tracks. I'll probably never be more than what I am right now."

"And what are you right now?"

The question surprised me. I looked up, met her eyes.

"I'm..." What was I? "I'm trying. To be better. To be more than people expect. To deserve—" I couldn't finish the sentence.

"To deserve me?" Grace squeezed my hand. "Tommy, worthiness isn't about money or addresses or jobs. It's about character. About trying. About caring. You've got all of that. You've always had it."

"Your town doesn't think so. Your father doesn't think so."

"I think so." Grace stepped even closer, and we were standing too close for propriety, too close for the watching congregation to miss. "Isn't that what matters? Not what they think, but what's actually true?"

"What's true is that you just risked everything to defend me in front of everyone you know." My voice cracked. "What's true is that you're brave and I'm a coward who's been avoiding you for weeks."

"You're not a coward. You're scared. There's a difference." Grace's eyes were fierce. "And I'm scared too. Terrified, actually. But I'm more terrified of going back to that hollow existence, pretending I don't feel what I feel."

"What do you feel?"

The question came out barely above a whisper. Around us, the world continued—people watching, whispers carrying, her father probably heading this way. But in this moment, it was just us.

"I care about you," Grace said simply. "More than I should probably admit out loud in a public parking lot with half the congregation watching. But there it is. I care about you, Tommy Keane. And I'm choosing to care about you regardless of what anyone else thinks."

Choosing. That word again.

She'd chosen to stand up. Chosen to speak. Chosen to walk over here despite everyone watching. Chosen me over comfort and approval and the easy path.

Could I choose her back? Choose to believe I might be worthy of her faith? Choose to try despite my terror of failing?

Grace was looking at me with desperate hope and determined courage all mixed together, waiting for me to say something, do something, be brave enough to meet her halfway.

I tightened my grip on her hand.

"I care about you too," I said, and the words felt like falling and flying simultaneously. "Have for months. Tried to stop, couldn't. Tried to stay away, failed. You make me want to be better than I thought I could be."

Grace's smile broke through her tears like sunrise. "Then be better. Not for me—for you. Be the person you want to be. I'll believe in that person regardless of what anyone else says."

"Even if it's hard?"

"Especially if it's hard." She looked back at the congregation still watching. "I just stood up there and called them all hypocrites. I think I can handle hard."

I laughed despite everything. She was right. If Grace Mitchell could do that, could burn down her comfortable life for the sake of truth, then maybe I could find the courage to believe her faith in me wasn't misplaced.

Maybe I could try.

"Okay," I said.

"Okay?" Hope lit her face.

"Okay, I'll try. I'll..." I took a breath. "I'll stop believing everyone's worst opinions about me. I'll try to see what you apparently see."

"You're worth it, Tommy. You're worth fighting for." Grace squeezed my hand. "You're worth the risk."

Over her shoulder, I saw Pastor Mitchell emerge from the crowd, heading our direction. His face was unreadable.

"Your father's coming," I said.

Grace glanced back, then looked at me again. "We should talk to him. Together."

Together.

The word felt terrifying and right all at once.

"You sure?"

"I'm sure." Grace turned, keeping hold of my hand, facing her father's approach with her chin up and her shoulders back.

She'd crossed the distance between her world and mine. She'd spoken truth at personal cost. She'd chosen me publicly and irreversibly.

The least I could do was stand beside her and face whatever came next.

Together.
