# Chapter 9: Connection Through Words

Grace didn't tell anyone about the poetry.

I waited for Mrs. Kowalski to mention it, or for one of the kids to comment. But nothing. Grace kept it to herself, and that secret became something private between us. Something more intimate than I was prepared for.

Two days after she caught me with Whitman, she showed up with a book.

Saturday morning, the center was busy with kids. I was fixing a loose table leg when Grace appeared in the doorway of the storage room, holding a slim volume.

"I brought you something," she said.

I looked up from my work. "What?"

She held out the book. "Robert Frost. You said you liked him. I thought you might want to borrow this."

I stared at the book. It was a nice edition, hardcover with a green cloth binding. The kind of book that belonged in a proper home, not in my toolbox.

"I can't take that."

"It's just a loan. You can give it back when you're done."

"Grace—"

"Please. I'd like to know what you think of the poems I've marked."

That caught me. "You marked poems?"

"Ones I want to discuss with you. If you have time."

I took the book. Opened it carefully. She'd put small strips of paper to mark certain pages—"Mending Wall," "The Road Not Taken," "Birches," "Fire and Ice."

"Why?" I asked.

"Because I've never had anyone to talk to about poetry. My English teacher just wanted the 'right' answers. My friends think it's boring. But you actually care about what it means."

I looked at her standing in the doorway, offering me her book and her trust. Wanting to talk about poetry like it was something that mattered.

"Okay," I heard myself say. "I'll read them."

Her smile could've lit up the whole center.

After that, it became a pattern. Grace would bring books, leave them in the storage room. During quiet moments, we'd slip into that small room and talk about poetry.

Tuesday afternoon, we discussed "The Road Not Taken."

"Everyone thinks it's about individuality," Grace said, sitting on her usual paint can while I leaned against the workbench. "About taking the brave path less traveled."

"But that's not what he's saying," I said. "He says both paths were about the same. The whole thing is kind of ironic—he's going to tell people he took the road less traveled, but really it was just a choice."

"Exactly!" Grace leaned forward, excited. "It's about how we construct narratives about our lives after the fact. How we tell ourselves stories about our choices."

"Yeah. Makes you think about whether choices are as important as we pretend they are."

"Or maybe they're important because we make them mean something, not because they're inherently different."

We talked for twenty minutes about two roads diverging in a yellow wood. About choices and narratives and what made a life meaningful. It was the kind of conversation I'd imagined having someday, somewhere, with someone who understood that words mattered.

I'd never imagined having it in a storage room with Pastor Mitchell's daughter.

Thursday she brought Emily Dickinson—poems about narrow fellows in grass and hope as a thing with feathers. Friday we discussed Sandburg's "Chicago," about hog butchers and tool makers and the rough vitality of cities.

"I love how he doesn't pretty it up," Grace said. "He calls Chicago brutal and wicked, but he loves it anyway. Loves it because of what it is, not despite it."

"Kind of like how you should love people," I said without thinking.

Grace looked at me. "What do you mean?"

I shifted, uncomfortable with where this was heading. "I mean... people aren't perfect. Cities aren't perfect. Maybe real love is seeing the rough parts and not running away."

"Yes." Her voice was soft. "I think that's exactly right."

The way she looked at me made my chest tight.

Wednesday of the second week, our conversation shifted. We were sitting in the storage room after finishing Frost—her on the paint can, me on my overturned crate, the distance between us maybe three feet but feeling like less.

"Can I ask you something personal?" Grace said.

"I guess."

"How did you start reading poetry? I mean, it's not exactly..."

"Not exactly what guys from my neighborhood do?"

"I wasn't going to say it like that."

"But it's true." I looked at the book in my hands. "I don't know. I was fifteen, cutting through the library to get out of the rain. Saw a book lying on a table someone had left—Whitman. The cover was interesting, so I opened it. Started reading."

"And you liked it?"

"I didn't understand half of it. But there was something... I don't know. It made me feel like there was more to the world than the rail yard and the neighborhood. Like there were bigger thoughts and bigger feelings than what I saw every day."

"So you kept reading."

"Kept stealing books." I smiled wryly. "Library doesn't exactly give cards to dropout railroad workers."

Grace frowned. "That's not right. Everyone should have access to books."

"Should and do are different things."

She was quiet for a moment, then: "Do you ever feel trapped, Tommy?"

The question surprised me. "What?"

"Trapped. By where you're from, by what people expect, by... everything."

I looked at her. There was something vulnerable in her expression. Something that made her seem less like the untouchable pastor's daughter and more like just a girl asking an honest question.

"Yeah," I said. "All the time."

"Me too."

"But you're..." I gestured vaguely. "You've got options. College, good family, possibilities."

"Do I? Or do I have a script I'm expected to follow?"

"That's different from having no options at all."

"Is it? You can dream about leaving, even if it's hard. I'm not even allowed to dream about something different. I'm supposed to want exactly what my parents want for me."

I'd never thought about it like that. "What do your parents want?"

"For me to be the perfect pastor's daughter. Marry someone from a good family. Have children. Support my husband's career. Be a credit to my father's ministry." She looked down at her hands. "All good things. Nothing wrong with any of it. But nobody's ever asked me what I want."

"What do you want?"

"I don't even know. That's the problem. I've never been allowed to want anything different, so I don't know how to figure out what I actually want versus what I've been told to want."

I understood that feeling more than she probably realized. "It's like being in a cage," I said. "Even if it's a nice cage."

"Yes. Exactly." She looked at me. "Maybe we're both trapped. Just in different ways. You by low expectations, me by high ones."

The idea settled between us—that we were both prisoners of other people's ideas about who we should be. Different cells, different bars, but both trapped.

"I dropped out of school when I was sixteen," I said. Not sure why I was telling her this, but needing to say it. "After my father's injury. We needed money, and I could work full-time at the yard. But sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I'd stayed. If I could've finished, maybe gone to college."

"You could still finish," Grace said.

I shook my head. "I'm eighteen with a tenth-grade education and a full-time job. There's no path from here to college."

"But there could be. You could get your diploma, save money—"

"Grace, guys like me don't go to college. That's not how the world works."

"But why not? You're smart. You read poetry and think about things and have opinions worth hearing. Why shouldn't you go to college if you wanted to?"

"Because I load freight cars for thirty-eight dollars a week. Because I've got coal dust under my nails and no connections and nobody who believes I could do more. Because the world has slots for guys like me, and college isn't one of them."

She looked frustrated. "That's not fair."

"No. But it's true."

"It doesn't have to be."

"Doesn't it? You said it yourself—you're in a cage too. Maybe we're all in cages. Some are just nicer than others."

Grace was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "What if we helped each other get out?"

"What?"

"Our cages. What if we helped each other? I can't see my own bars clearly because I've lived with them so long. But maybe you can see them. And maybe I can see yours."

I didn't know what to say to that. The idea was beautiful and impossible at the same time.

"I think it's more complicated than that," I said finally.

"Probably. But maybe worth trying?"

Before I could answer, Mrs. Kowalski's voice called for Grace. She stood, straightening her dress.

"Thank you for talking with me," she said. "About real things. It means more than you probably know."

She left me alone in the storage room.

I sat there holding Robert Frost's poems, thinking about cages and poetry and the way Grace looked at me like my thoughts mattered. Like I was someone worth knowing, not just the guy who fixed broken things.

The conversations we'd been having weren't just about poetry anymore. They were about bigger things—about who we were, who we wanted to be, what trapped us and what might set us free.

And the more we talked, the more the careful distance I'd been trying to maintain crumbled away.

Because Grace didn't just accept that I read poetry. She brought me books. Wanted to discuss them. Valued my interpretations. Shared her own struggles with me like I was someone who could understand.

She saw me. Really saw me—not the railroad worker or the rough kid from the wrong neighborhood, but the person underneath who thought and felt and wanted more than the life laid out for him.

And I was starting to see her too. Not the perfect pastor's daughter, but a girl who felt trapped in her own way. Who wanted things she couldn't name. Who was tired of performing for everyone around her.

We'd found something in that storage room, talking about words and meaning. Something that felt precious and fragile and dangerous all at once.

I returned to work, fixed the rest of the table, helped some kids with a project. But part of my mind stayed in that storage room, turning over what Grace had said.

What if we helped each other get out?

It was probably impossible. Probably foolish to even consider.

But for the first time in my life, talking to Grace about poetry and cages and possibility, I felt like maybe there was more to me than coal dust and resignation.

Maybe I did contain multitudes after all.
