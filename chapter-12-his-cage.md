# Chapter 12: His Cage

The next afternoon, we both arrived at the center early.

I'd finished my rail yard shift and come straight over, still had an hour before the kids would start showing up. Grace's father had dropped her off on his way to a church meeting. We found ourselves alone on the old wooden benches outside the center, sitting in the shade of the oak tree that grew against the building.

Grace had brought lemonade in a thermos—she'd started doing that, bringing things to share. Small domestic gestures that shouldn't have meant as much as they did.

We sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, drinking lemonade, watching a stray cat hunt something in the overgrown grass behind the lot.

"Can I ask you something?" Grace said.

"Sure."

"What was it like? Growing up here, I mean. On this side of town."

Most people from her world didn't ask. Didn't want to know. But Grace's question was genuine, so I found myself answering honestly.

"It was knowing you didn't matter much," I said. "To anyone outside your immediate family, and sometimes not even to them."

"What do you mean?"

I set my lemonade down on the bench between us. "From the time I can remember, people expected nothing from me. I was a Keane from the wrong neighborhood. That meant certain things."

"Like what?"

"Like I'd probably drop out. Probably end up working the railroad or the factory. Probably wouldn't amount to much. Those weren't possibilities—they were assumptions. Facts people accepted about me before I'd even done anything."

Grace frowned. "That's horrible."

"It's just how it was." I picked at a splinter on the bench. "Teachers in elementary school were nice enough. But by middle school, they'd given up. They'd seen enough Keane boys come through to know how it ended."

"But you're smart. Surely they could see that."

"Didn't matter. I remember in eighth grade, Mrs. Henderson taught English. She had us write essays about what we wanted to be when we grew up. I wrote about maybe being a mechanic, having my own shop someday."

"That sounds like a good goal."

"She gave it back with a note that said I should 'be more realistic about my prospects.' She meant well, probably. Trying to save me from disappointment. But what she really meant was guys like me don't get to have shops. We work in them, maybe, but we don't own them."

I could see anger flickering in Grace's eyes. "She was wrong."

"Maybe. But she wasn't the only one. There was Mr. Patterson in ninth grade—he taught history. Smart man, good teacher. But he had this way of looking through kids from my neighborhood. Like we were taking up space in his classroom that could've gone to someone who'd actually do something with the education."

"How did he treat you?"

"He didn't call on me even when I raised my hand. Didn't push me when I gave minimal effort. When my grades slipped, he didn't pull me aside to ask what was wrong—he just accepted it as inevitable. Tommy Keane was falling behind. Of course he was."

Grace's hands were clenched in her lap. "Those teachers failed you."

"They failed a lot of kids from this neighborhood."

"But especially you. You were sitting right there, wanting to learn, and they just... gave up on you."

Her anger on my behalf felt strange. Good, but strange. Nobody had ever been angry about how I'd been treated before.

"By the time I was sixteen, staying in school felt pointless," I continued. "The teachers had written me off. My father kept saying I was wasting time, that I should just start at the yard already since that's where I'd end up anyway. And when Dad got injured, we needed the money."

"But you said before that wasn't the only reason you dropped out."

I looked at her, surprised she'd remembered that conversation from weeks ago. "No. It wasn't."

"Then what was the real reason?"

Nobody had ever asked me that before. My mother had been too worried about money to question it. My father had been relieved. My sister was too young to understand. The school had barely noticed I was gone.

"It hurt too much to stay," I said quietly.

"What hurt?"

"Being there. Sitting in classrooms where teachers looked through me like I was invisible. Where I could raise my hand and be ignored. Where I could try and have it not matter because everyone already knew I'd fail eventually."

My voice was rougher than I meant it to be.

"Walking through halls where kids from the right neighborhood wouldn't make eye contact. Where girls like you—" I stopped, then continued carefully "—girls from good families wouldn't be caught dead talking to guys like me. Where everyone had already decided who I was and what I'd become, and nothing I did would change that."

"So you left."

"So I left. Easier to quit than keep trying when nobody thought trying mattered."

Grace was quiet for a long moment. When I finally looked at her, there were tears in her eyes.

"That's not right," she said fiercely. "None of that was right. You deserved better. You deserved teachers who pushed you, who saw your potential, who believed in you."

"Maybe. But that's not what I got."

"You were sixteen years old and you'd been told your whole life that you didn't matter. And instead of anyone fighting for you, they just let you give up."

"I made the choice to leave."

"Did you? Or did they make it for you by creating an environment where leaving was easier than staying?"

I'd never thought about it that way. Always figured it was my fault for being too weak to stick it out, for letting other people's low expectations become my own.

"The world doesn't work on should-have-beens," I said. "It works on what is. And what is: I'm eighteen years old with a tenth-grade education. I load freight cars. I've got coal dust ground so deep under my nails it'll never come out. I've got a reputation as a rough kid from the wrong neighborhood."

"You're also smart and thoughtful and kind. You read poetry. You help kids. You fix things. You care about people."

"None of that changes my address or my education or my prospects."

"It changes how I see you."

The words hit harder than expected. "Grace—"

"Those teachers were wrong about you, Tommy. Your father is wrong about you. Everyone who looked at you and saw nothing but another railroad worker was wrong. You're more than that."

"Wanting to be more doesn't make it true."

"But you are more. You contain multitudes, remember? Whitman said so."

Despite everything, I smiled. "I don't think Whitman was talking about guys like me."

"I think he was talking about exactly guys like you. People who don't fit in the boxes society puts them in. People who are more complex than anyone gives them credit for."

We sat there in the shade, the thermos of lemonade between us getting warm, and I felt something shifting in my chest.

Grace saw me. Not the Tommy Keane everyone expected—rough, limited, going nowhere. She saw the person I kept hidden. The one who read poetry and wanted more and cared about things beyond survival.

And she didn't just see it. She was angry about how I'd been treated. Angry that teachers had given up on me. Angry that I'd been taught not to expect anything better.

"I appreciate what you're saying," I told her. "But intelligence and good character don't pay bills or erase the past or open doors that are closed."

"Maybe not. But they matter anyway."

"To who?"

"To me."

The simplicity of it caught me off guard. To me. Like that was enough reason. Like her seeing value in me made it real.

I reached for the book of Frost poems she'd brought with her, the one sitting on the bench. At the exact same moment, she reached for it too.

Our hands collided.

Neither of us pulled away.

Her hand was soft, small under mine. I could feel her pulse in her wrist, quick like a bird's. We both froze, hands touching over the book, neither moving.

The moment stretched. I should pull away. Should make some joke, break the tension. Should do anything but sit here with my hand covering hers, feeling the warmth of her skin, the slight tremor that might have been hers or might have been mine.

Grace looked up at me. We were close—had been sitting close the whole time without realizing it. Close enough that I could see the gold flecks in her brown eyes, could count her eyelashes, could smell that flower scent that always clung to her.

"Tommy," she said softly.

Her voice did something to me. Made my heart slam against my ribs. Made me hyperaware of every point where we were almost touching—hands on the book, knees inches apart, shoulders nearly brushing.

This was dangerous. This moment, this closeness, this girl who saw me and made me believe I could be more than I was.

This was the edge of something I couldn't take back.

Slowly, carefully, I pulled my hand away. Picked up the book, handed it to her. Put physical distance where there'd been contact.

"We should probably get ready," I said, voice not quite steady. "Kids will be here soon."

Grace took the book, clutching it against her chest like a shield. "Right. Yes. Of course."

But neither of us moved. We sat there on that bench, both shaken by the moment that had just almost become something more.

"Grace—"

"I know," she said quietly. "I know it's complicated. I know we're from different worlds. I know people would talk. I know my father would—" She stopped. "I know all the reasons why this is impossible."

"Then why does it feel so possible when we're together?"

The question slipped out before I could stop it.

She looked at me with eyes that held the same confusion, the same longing, the same fear I was feeling.

"I don't know," she whispered. "But it does."

We were getting too close. Had gotten too close. Our cages might be different, but the bars were real and they separated us as surely as the railroad tracks divided Copper Ridge.

But sitting there with Grace, hands still warm from touching, hearts still racing from what almost happened, those bars felt less solid than they ever had before.

And that terrified me more than anything.
