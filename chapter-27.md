# Chapter 27: Choosing Better

I drove home from the center in a daze, Grace's words circling my head like birds I couldn't catch.

Start small. Start by believing maybe I'm not delusional.

Could I do that? Could I choose to believe—even a little—that I might be worth the faith she was placing in me?

The house was dark when I pulled up except for the porch light. I should have gone straight inside, straight to bed. Tomorrow I'd promised Grace we'd talk to her father together. I needed sleep, needed to prepare myself for that conversation.

But Frank was on the porch, bottle in hand, staring at nothing. The sight was so familiar it was almost comforting in its predictability. Some things never changed.

I climbed the steps, planning to nod and go inside. But Frank spoke before I could.

"Heard about the revival meeting," he said without looking at me.

I froze, hand on the door. "Yeah?"

"Whole town's talking. Pastor's daughter making a speech about judgment and hypocrisy." He took a drink. "About some boy from the wrong neighborhood everyone misjudged."

"Frank—"

"That was you she was talking about." He finally looked at me. His eyes were clearer than they should have been with that much whiskey in him. "Wasn't it?"

No point lying. "Yeah."

"Hmm." Frank turned back to staring at the street. At the distant gleam of railroad tracks under streetlights. "Takes guts to stand up like that. In front of the whole town. Calling people on their bull."

I didn't know what to say. This wasn't mockery or bitterness. This was something else entirely.

"She's something, that girl," Frank continued. "Standing up to her own father. Risking her reputation for what she believes is right." He paused. "For you."

"I don't—I don't know why she did it."

"Don't you?" Frank looked at me again, and something in his expression was almost gentle. "She sees something in you worth defending. Something worth the risk."

My throat felt tight. "You think she's wrong?"

"I think I've been wrong." The words came out quiet. "About you. About what you could be."

I sat down abruptly on the porch step, legs suddenly unsteady.

Frank took another drink, gathering words. "I've been hard on you your whole life. Harder than I should have been. You know why?"

"Because I remind you of your failures?" The words came out before I could stop them.

"Because you remind me of my potential." Frank's voice was rough. "When I look at you, I see everything I could have been if I'd had the guts to try. Everything I gave up on because it was easier to accept what everyone said about me."

He set down the bottle, looking at his hands—weathered, scarred, permanently stained from years of railroad work.

"I was smart once. Not book smart maybe, but I could fix anything, figure things out. Had ideas. Had dreams." He laughed bitterly. "Had a girl once who looked at me the way that pastor's daughter looks at you. Like I was worth something more than what everyone said."

"What happened?"

"I got scared. Listened to everyone who told me to be realistic. Accepted the limitations they put on me because fighting them seemed too hard." He looked at me. "Married your mother, which was the best thing I ever did. But I never tried for more. Never believed I could be anything beyond what my father was, what his father was. Just accepted it."

"That's not—"

"It is. And I see you making the same choice." Frank's voice was harder now. "See you accepting everyone's low opinions. Believing you're not good enough for that girl. Convincing yourself you don't deserve more than loading freight until your back breaks like mine."

The words hit too close to truth.

"But here's the thing, Tommy." Frank leaned forward. "You're better than I was. Smarter. Kinder. Your mother tells me you read poetry—real poetry, not just magazines. Tells me you help those kids at the center not for money but because you care. Tells me you think about things, question things, want more from life than just getting by."

"Ma talks too much."

"Your ma sees you clearly. So does that pastor's daughter, apparently." Frank picked up his bottle again. "So why the hell are you the only one who can't see it?"

I didn't have an answer.

"That girl stood up in front of God and everyone," Frank continued. "Called out the whole town's prejudice. Defended you when it would have been easier to stay quiet. You know what that means?"

"That she's brave and I'm not?"

"That she believes in you more than you believe in yourself." Frank's voice was almost angry now. "And you're going to waste that. Going to convince yourself you're not worth it. Going to do exactly what I did—accept limitations instead of fighting them."

"What do you want me to do?"

"I want you to try!" Frank stood abruptly, unsteady but intense. "Try to be more than this. More than me. More than what everyone expects from wrong-side-of-the-tracks boys. That girl sees something worth fighting for—trust her judgment instead of my bitter wisdom."

He headed for the door, then paused.

"Don't make my mistakes, Tommy. Don't let fear keep you small. Don't accept what everyone says you are when you could discover what you actually could be." He looked back at me, and something in his expression was heartbreaking. "Be better than I was. Please."

He went inside, leaving me alone on the porch with those words hanging in the night air.

My father—bitter, broken Frank Keane who'd spent years telling me I'd amount to nothing—had just told me to be better than him.

Had just given me permission to try.

I sat there for a long time, watching the stars, listening to trains in the distance. Thinking about Frank's wasted potential. About Grace's courage. About my own fear that had been masquerading as realism.

What was I so afraid of?

Failing? I was already failing by not trying.

Disappointing people? I'd been disappointing myself for years by believing their limitations.

Being wrong about who I could be? What if I was right, and I was more than everyone said?

What if Grace was right, and I was worth the faith she'd placed in me?

What if Frank was right, and choosing to try was the bravest thing I could do?

I went to bed but didn't sleep. Just stared at the ceiling, thinking. Choosing.

By the time dawn light filtered through my window, I'd made a decision.

I was going to try. Really try. Not just for Grace, though I wanted to be worth her faith. But for myself. For the kid who'd hidden poetry books because he was ashamed of wanting more. For Danny and the others at the center who needed to see that trying was possible. For Frank, who'd never gotten to discover his potential.

For me.

I was done accepting everyone's limitations. Done believing I was destined for nothing more than loading freight and bitter resignation. Done hiding who I was to protect myself from judgment.

If I failed, at least I'd fail trying.

That was better than succeeding at giving up.

I showered, put on clean clothes, ate the breakfast Ma had left warming. She looked at me curiously but didn't ask questions.

Then I went to my truck and pulled out the Whitman book I'd kept hidden under the seat for months. Leaves of Grass, cover worn from secret reading.

I tucked it under my arm. Openly. Visibly.

And I walked into Joe's Diner.

The place was full of rail yard workers grabbing breakfast before shift. Rough men with rough hands doing rough work. Men who'd mock a guy for reading poetry, for wanting more, for thinking he could be anything beyond what they were.

Men like I'd been pretending to be.

But I wasn't pretending anymore.

I walked to the counter, Whitman visible under my arm. Ordered coffee. Sat on a stool and opened the book to a page I'd marked months ago. "Song of Myself."

I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume...

"That poetry?"

I looked up. Marty stood next to me, eyes on the book.

"Yeah."

"Since when do you read poetry?"

"Since always. Just stopped hiding it." I met his eyes. "Done pretending to be what people expect."

Marty studied me for a long moment. Then he grinned—wide and genuine. "About damn time."

He clapped me on the shoulder and walked to his usual booth, leaving me with my coffee and my book and my choice to be visible.

A few guys glanced at me. Noticed the book. I waited for mockery, for judgment.

Nobody said anything. Maybe they didn't care. Maybe I'd been wrong about what they'd think.

Or maybe it didn't matter what they thought.

I drank my coffee, read my poetry, and felt lighter than I had in years.

When I finished, I left the diner with the book still under my arm. Drove to the community center. Walked inside where kids were starting to gather for after-school programs.

Mrs. Kowalski saw the book, saw my face, and smiled knowingly.

Grace was in the corner setting up story time. She looked up, saw me, saw the book.

Her smile was sunrise and hope and belief all mixed together.

I walked over to her, Whitman still visible, still claiming who I was openly.

"Hi," I said.

"Hi." Grace's eyes were bright. "Is that—"

"Whitman. Thought maybe we could talk about it with the kids later. Poetry's not just for rich people, right?"

"Right." Grace's voice was soft. "You're really doing this."

"Trying to." I showed her the book. "Being visible. Being who I actually am instead of who everyone expects. Figured I'd start small."

"That's not small, Tommy. That's brave."

Maybe it was. Maybe choosing to be seen was the bravest thing I'd ever done.

"About your father," I said. "About talking to him together. I'm ready. If you still want to."

"I do."

"Today?"

"Today." Grace reached out, took my hand. "Together."

Together. Visible. Choosing to try.

For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe I could be someone worth being.

Not despite where I came from.

But because of who I chose to be.
