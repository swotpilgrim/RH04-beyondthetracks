# Chapter 28: She Sees Him

Grace was reading to a small group of kids when I walked into the center, Whitman still tucked under my arm.

She looked up mid-sentence, saw me, and her voice faltered. Her eyes went to the book—visible, obvious, proudly carried. Then to my face.

Something lit up in her expression. Hope. Question. Recognition.

I waited at the edge of the room while she finished the story. Danny noticed me and grinned wide. Other kids turned to look. Whispers rippled through the group.

Tommy's back. Tommy brought a book. Tommy looks different.

Did I look different? I felt different. Lighter somehow, despite the weight of what I was about to do.

Grace finished the story, told the kids to start their homework, and walked over to me. The room didn't even pretend not to watch.

"Hi," she said, eyes bright.

"Hi." I held up the book. "Thought maybe we could read some Whitman to the kids later. If that's okay."

"That's more than okay." Grace's smile was tremulous. "You're really carrying it openly."

"Figured it was time to stop hiding who I am." I glanced at the kids watching us. "All of who I am."

"Tommy—"

"Can we talk? Just for a minute?"

She nodded, and we moved to the quieter corner near the windows. Not the storage room this time. Not hidden. Just slightly apart from the group.

"I've been scared," I started, words I'd practiced on the drive over suddenly feeling inadequate. "Scared of disappointing you. Scared of proving everyone right about me. Scared of being exactly what your father thinks, what the town says, what I've always been told. Scared that if I try and fail, it'll hurt worse than never trying at all."

Grace started to speak, but I kept going. I needed to say this.

"But staying scared means staying small. Means accepting the limitations everyone else set for me before I even had a chance to discover my own capabilities. Means giving up before I even try." I looked down at the Whitman book, its worn cover familiar in my hands. "You made me see I could be more. But you can't make me believe it. I have to believe it myself. I have to choose it."

"And do you?" Grace's voice was barely above a whisper. "Believe it?"

"I'm trying to. I am trying." I met her eyes. "I talked to my father last night. He told me something that surprised me—he said he sees potential in me he never reached himself. Told me not to make his mistakes. Not to accept what everyone says I am when I could discover what I could actually be."

Grace's eyes widened slightly.

"And I realized he was right. You were right. Everyone who's believed in me was right." I took a breath. "I'm not perfect. Probably never will be. I'm still rough around the edges, still from the wrong side of the tracks, still loading freight cars for a living. Still the guy who gets into fights when he's protecting someone. Still limited in a hundred ways I can't even name yet."

"Tommy—"

"But I'm also thoughtful. I care about things. I read poetry and think about meaning and want more from life than just resignation." The words came faster now, everything I'd realized. "I'm good with kids because I remember being one with no one looking out for me. I protect people who need protecting because that matters more than keeping my head down. I contain multitudes, like Whitman said. All of that is real. All of that is me."

Grace's eyes were wet with tears.

"I can't promise you an easy path," I continued. "Your father might never fully accept me. The town will judge us. I don't have money or prospects or a respectable future lined up. I can't offer you the comfortable life you could have with someone from your own world."

"I don't want comfortable—"

"But I care about you more than I've cared about anything in my life." The admission felt like opening a door I'd kept locked. "You make me want to be better—not different, better. More fully myself. The person I could be if I stopped limiting myself. And I will try. Every single day, I will try. If you'll let me."

Grace was crying openly now, smiling through tears. "That's all I want. Just you trying. Just you being yourself—all of yourself, not the limited version you thought you had to be."

"I'm terrified I'll disappoint you."

"And I'm terrified too." She reached out, took my hand. "But that's okay. We can be terrified together. We can try together."

Around us, the center had gone quiet. Kids watching. Mrs. Kowalski pretending to organize supplies but obviously listening. Danny with a huge grin on his face.

I squeezed Grace's hand, very aware we were being watched. Very deliberately not letting go.

"I see you," I said quietly. "Not the perfect pastor's daughter everyone expects you to be. Not the role you've been performing. I see the real you—brave enough to stand up to your whole community. Kind enough to care about kids everyone else ignores. Strong enough to choose your own path. Smart and thoughtful and real."

Grace's breath caught.

"Maybe we can be real together," I said. "Stop performing. Stop hiding. Just... be who we actually are."

"Yes." The word came out choked with emotion. "Yes. That's exactly what I want."

She stepped closer, and I was intensely aware of her proximity. Of how easy it would be to close that last bit of distance. Of how much I wanted to.

Of how many people were watching.

But I also didn't care. Let them watch. Let them see that the rough kid from the wrong neighborhood and the pastor's daughter had chosen each other. Let them talk.

We'd be real anyway.

I started to lean in, and Grace rose slightly on her toes, and—

"Ooooh!"

The sound came from a group of kids who'd been watching with rapt attention. Followed by giggles. Catcalls. Danny making kissing noises.

I pulled back, laughing despite myself. Grace's face was bright red, but she was laughing too.

"Subtle," I called to Danny.

"You were about to kiss!" he called back, delighted. "In front of everyone!"

"And that's our cue to maybe have some boundaries," Mrs. Kowalski said, but she was smiling. "This is still a community center, you two."

Grace buried her face in my shoulder, still laughing. "Oh my God."

"Yeah." I was grinning like an idiot. "Maybe we should talk to your father first. Before we scandalize the youth of Copper Ridge."

She pulled back, looked up at me. "You're ready for that? Really ready?"

"Terrified. But ready." I tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, not caring who saw. "We said we'd do it together. So let's do it together."

"Today?"

"Today. Right now, if you want." I glanced at the kids still watching. "Unless you have story time to finish."

"Mrs. Kowalski can cover for me." Grace turned to the older woman. "Can you?"

"Go." Mrs. Kowalski shooed us. "Talk to your father. Face this head-on. These kids will survive without you for an afternoon."

Grace grabbed her sweater. I kept hold of her hand.

We walked out together, past the kids who cheered, past Mrs. Kowalski who gave me an approving nod, into the September afternoon.

"Thank you," Grace said as we reached my truck.

"For what?"

"For trying. For believing you're worth it. For carrying that book openly and being yourself and—" She gestured at everything. "For choosing."

"Thank you for making me believe choosing was possible." I opened the truck door for her. "For seeing something in me worth defending. For being brave first."

"We can be brave together now."

"Yeah." I closed her door, walked around to my side. "Together."

The drive to her house was short. Too short. My hands were sweating on the wheel by the time we pulled up.

Pastor Mitchell's car was in the driveway. He was home.

This was really happening.

"You okay?" Grace asked.

"No." I turned off the engine. "But I'm doing it anyway."

"That's what courage is." She took my hand. "Being terrified and doing it anyway."

"Then I guess we're about to be very courageous."

We sat there for a moment, holding hands, gathering strength.

Then Grace squeezed my fingers. "Ready?"

Was I? Was anyone ever really ready to face their fears head-on?

But Grace was here. And I'd promised to try. And trying meant facing this.

"Yeah," I said. "I'm ready."

We got out of the truck together. Walked up the path to her front door together. Knocked together.

Pastor Mitchell opened the door, saw us holding hands, and his expression went through several emotions at once—surprise, concern, resignation, something that might have been reluctant acceptance.

"Grace," he said. Then, more carefully, "Tommy."

"Dad." Grace's voice was steady. "We'd like to talk to you. If that's okay."

He looked at our joined hands. At my face. At Grace's determined expression.

Finally, he stepped back. "Come in."

Grace looked at me. I looked at her.

Together, we crossed the threshold.

Together, we'd face whatever came next.

Because I wasn't the limited person everyone said I was.

And Grace wasn't the performing perfect daughter.

We were real. We were choosing. We were trying.

And maybe—just maybe—that would be enough.
