# Chapter 17: Forbidden

Sunday, I stayed away from the center. Couldn't face the disappointment I'd seen on Grace's face, or worse—the fear. Spent the day helping my father with odd jobs, anything to keep my hands busy and my mind from replaying that fight.

My eye had swollen shut by morning, purple and ugly. Split lip crusted over. Ribs ached with every breath. Ma asked what happened. I told her I'd fallen at work. She didn't believe me, but she didn't push.

Monday afternoon, I couldn't stay away. I needed to check on Danny, make sure Eddie hadn't gotten to him. Make sure the kid was okay after watching us beat each other bloody over him.

The parking lot was nearly empty when I pulled in. The fence I'd been fixing still hung crooked, tools abandoned where I'd dropped them. Shame heated my face.

Inside, the center felt different. Quieter. A handful of kids doing homework looked up when I walked in, their expressions wary. Like I was a stranger instead of someone they'd known for months.

"Tommy." Mrs. Kowalski emerged from her office, her face sad. Not angry—I could have handled angry. Just sad, like she'd expected better. "Danny's in the back. He's been asking about you."

"Is he okay?" My voice came out rougher than I meant. "Eddie didn't—"

"He's fine. Shaken up, but fine." She touched my arm briefly, her weathered hand gentle. "Grace is here too. In the storage room. She's been waiting for you."

My heart kicked against my ribs. "She has?"

Mrs. Kowalski just looked at me with those knowing eyes, then walked back to her office. The message was clear: whatever was coming, I had to face it myself.

I found Danny shooting baskets alone in the corner. When he saw me, he stopped, ball tucked under his thin arm.

"Hey, kid."

"Your face looks bad."

"Eddie's looks worse." I tried for a smile, but my split lip protested. "You doing okay?"

He shrugged. "Mrs. Kowalski says you were trying to protect me."

"I was." I crouched down, eye level with him, ignoring my ribs' protest. "Eddie's bad news, Danny. I know it seems like easy money, but it's not worth it. I've been where you are."

"He said you used to run with them. Is that true?"

"Yeah." No point lying. "That's how I know what Eddie really wants."

"What does he want?"

"Someone to take the fall when things go wrong. Don't be that someone."

"Eddie says you think you're better than everyone now."

"Eddie's wrong about a lot of things. I didn't forget where I came from. I just decided not to stay there." I stood, my knees cracking. "There's a difference."

Danny spun the basketball in his hands. "Miss Grace was crying after you left."

Something in my chest clenched tight. "Yeah?"

"She kept asking if you were okay. Her mom had to take her home." He bounced the ball once, twice. "Is she in trouble because of what happened?"

"I don't know." But I did know. Of course Grace was in trouble. Her mother had watched me bloody someone in a parking lot full of children. Had watched me be exactly what Pastor Mitchell had probably warned her about. "Listen, Danny, I need to talk to Miss Grace. You okay out here?"

He nodded, already turning back to the basket. I left him there and walked toward the storage room on legs that felt heavier with each step.

Grace was sitting on the overturned crate where we'd talked about poetry, a book open in her lap that she wasn't reading. She looked up when I appeared in the doorway, and I saw her eyes widen slightly at my face.

"Tommy." She stood quickly, and for a moment I thought she might come to me. But she didn't. She stayed where she was, hands clasped in front of her. Formal. Distant. Nothing like the girl who'd laughed with me over Whitman and touched my hand when passing lemonade.

"Hey." I stayed in the doorway, suddenly unsure. "Mrs. Kowalski said you were waiting."

"I needed to talk to you." Her voice was quiet, controlled. The voice she probably used at church functions. "About what my father said."

The floor dropped out from under me. I'd known this was coming, but hearing it confirmed still felt like taking Eddie's fist to the gut all over again.

"Okay."

Grace took a breath, and I saw her hands tremble before she clasped them tighter. "My mother told him about the fight. About Eddie and..." She gestured vaguely at my face. "About everything. He says I can't come to the center anymore."

"That's probably smart." The words came automatically, protective walls slamming up. "Your dad's right. You saw what happened. This neighborhood—"

"He says I can't see you anymore either." Her voice cracked on the last word, and I watched her struggle to compose herself. "He forbids it. Said you're dangerous, a bad influence, exactly the kind of boy I should avoid."

Each word was a nail driving deeper. I'd known. Of course I'd known this would happen. But knowing and hearing it spoken out loud were two different kinds of pain.

"What did you tell him?" I asked, even though I wasn't sure I wanted to know.

"I tried to explain." Grace's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Told him you were protecting Danny. That Eddie was the real threat, that you were trying to keep him away from the kids. But he wouldn't listen."

"Can't blame him." My voice sounded dead even to my own ears. "He saw what everyone saw. Guy from the wrong side of the tracks beating someone bloody in front of children. In front of you."

"You were defending Danny—"

"I was fighting, Grace." I cut her off, maybe harder than necessary. "Doesn't matter why. Your father saw me be exactly what he thought I was. Violent. Rough. Wrong for you."

"That's not—" She stopped, blinked hard. A single tear escaped, tracking down her cheek. "He talked to people. Mrs. Walsh told him about your reputation, about you running with Eddie's crew before. He thinks the center was naive to trust you. He thinks I was naive."

Margaret Walsh. Of course. The town's most dedicated gossip, always ready to confirm someone's worst suspicions. I wanted to be angry, but what was the point? She'd only told the truth. I had run with Eddie's crew. I did have a reputation.

"Maybe he's right." I leaned against the doorframe, suddenly exhausted. "Maybe you were."

"Don't say that." Grace took a step toward me, then stopped. "My mother tried to mediate. She asked about you at the center, talked to Mrs. Kowalski. But in the end, she agrees with my father. She thinks I'm in over my head, that I don't understand what I'm getting into."

"She's not wrong."

"Stop agreeing with them!" The words burst out of her, sharp with frustration. "Stop acting like they're right about you!"

"Aren't they?" I straightened, and something in my chest was breaking but I couldn't let her see it. "Look at me, Grace. Really look. Bruised knuckles. Black eye. Blood on my shirt from fighting in front of kids. I'm exactly what your father thinks I am."

"You were protecting—"

"I know what I was doing." I cut her off again. "But that doesn't change how it looked. How it always looks. I'm a guy from the wrong neighborhood who solves problems with his fists. That's who I am. That's who I'll always be."

She was crying openly now, not bothering to hide it. "Is that really what you think?"

"It's what everyone thinks. Your father. Your mother. The whole damn town." I forced myself to hold her gaze. "They're not wrong, Grace. I tried to be something different, tried to pretend I could be the kind of guy who—" I stopped, swallowed hard. "But I can't. The fight proved it."

"So what are you saying?"

"I'm saying your father's right to keep you away from the center. Away from this neighborhood." Away from me. I didn't say it out loud, but we both heard it anyway. "You should listen to him."

"That's not what I want." Her voice broke on the last word.

"What you want doesn't matter." The words were cruel, and I saw them land like slaps. But I kept going because if I didn't push her away now, I'd break and beg her to stay. "Your father knows better. I know better. This thing between us—whatever it was—it was a mistake. You belong on your side of the tracks, and I belong on mine."

"Tommy—"

"You should go." I stepped back, out of the doorway, putting space between us. "Go home, Grace. Live the life you're supposed to live. Forget about this place. Forget about—" I couldn't say it. Couldn't tell her to forget about me, even though that's what needed to happen.

"I don't want to forget." She took a step toward me, and I took another step back. Her face crumpled. "Please don't do this."

"I'm not doing anything." My voice came out flat, empty. "I'm just accepting reality. Something I should have done from the start."

I turned and walked away before she could see my face, before she could see that I was breaking apart just as completely as she was. Behind me, I heard her sob—one sharp, broken sound that nearly stopped me in my tracks.

But I kept walking. Past Mrs. Kowalski's office, past the kids at their homework, out into the parking lot where my truck waited. The fence still hung crooked. I'd probably never fix it now.

Driving away was the hardest thing I'd ever done. In the rearview mirror, I saw the center shrinking, taking everything I'd hoped for with it.

Grace was right to cry. I'd pushed her away deliberately, cruelly. Told her we were a mistake when every moment with her had felt like the only thing I'd ever done right.

But she'd seen the fear in her eyes during the fight. Seen how everyone looked at me afterward. I was exactly what they thought—violent, rough, wrong for her.

Better she hated me now than grew to fear me later.

Better she went back to her safe life before I dragged her down into mine.

The railroad tracks gleamed in the afternoon sun as I crossed back to my side. Back where I belonged. Where I'd always belonged.

And Grace stayed on hers, where she'd always belonged too.

Exactly like it should be.

Even if it felt like dying.
