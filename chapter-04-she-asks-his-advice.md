# Chapter 4: She Asks His Advice

Saturday afternoons at the center were controlled chaos. School was out for the summer—twice as many kids, three times the energy. They ran in and out, voices echoing, tracking dirt across the floors Mrs. Kowalski had just mopped.

I was repainting the community room walls—a project put off for two years. Mrs. Kowalski had scrounged up paint donations, and I'd volunteered. Fresh cream color covering the dingy yellow. I worked methodically, keeping one eye on the room. Old habits from growing up here—always aware of your surroundings, always ready.

Grace arrived around two, wearing a blue sundress and carrying a canvas bag full of books. She'd been coming three times a week for two weeks now, and the kids were getting used to her. She greeted Mrs. Kowalski, then started setting up for story time in the corner by the windows.

Story time was her newest idea—reading aloud to the younger kids, trying to make books seem exciting instead of like schoolwork. It was a good idea in theory. In practice, getting kids from this neighborhood to sit still and listen was like herding cats.

I dipped my brush and kept painting, half-listening as Grace gathered the kids. Eight or nine of them today—the Carter twins, Maria Rodriguez, a handful of others. They circled around Grace like wolves testing territory.

"All right, everyone," Grace said, her voice bright with false confidence. "Who wants to hear a story?"

"What kind of story?" one of the Carter twins demanded.

"A really good one. It's about a boy who finds a magic—"

"I don't like magic stories," the other twin interrupted.

"Well, this one also has—"

"I'm hungry," little Maria said. "Can we have snacks first?"

"After the story, Mrs. Kowalski said—"

"That's not fair!" One of the younger boys—I thought his name was Bobby—crossed his arms. "We always have snacks at three."

"It's only two-thirty," Grace said, patience visibly fraying. "If you sit nicely and listen—"

"I don't want to sit nicely," a girl named Susan announced. "Sitting's boring."

I kept painting, listening to Grace try every tactic. Bribes—pick the next story if they listened now. Reason—only twenty minutes then they could play. Pleading—she'd worked hard to find a good story.

Nothing worked. The kids smelled her desperation and circled tighter. Someone started humming. Someone got up to look out the window. The Carter twins began shoving each other.

Grace's voice got tighter. "Please, everyone, just—"

"This is stupid," one of the twins said. "I'm going outside."

"Me too," his brother agreed.

"Wait, you can't just—"

But they were already heading for the door, and three more kids scrambled to follow them.

I watched Grace's shoulders slump. She looked at the four kids remaining—Maria and three others who hadn't quite committed to rebellion yet—and tried to smile.

"Well, how about we—"

"Can we do something else instead?" Maria asked in her small voice.

Twenty minutes. I'd been watching Grace struggle for twenty minutes, trying every approach she could think of and failing because she was trying too hard. Because she cared too much about doing it right and the kids could sense that caring like weakness.

I set down my paintbrush and walked over.

I didn't say anything at first. Just stood there next to Grace, looking at the kids. The four remaining ones glanced up at me, then at each other. The ones who'd been heading outside stopped in their tracks.

The room got quiet.

"Miss Mitchell is trying to read you a story," I said. My voice wasn't loud, but it cut through the chaos. "You're going to sit down, you're going to listen, or you're going to leave the center. Those are your choices."

The Carter twins exchanged looks. "We were just—"

"Sit down or leave. Decide now."

They sat.

I looked at the others. One by one, they drifted back to the circle around Grace. Some sat on the floor, some on the old cushions Mrs. Kowalski had scattered around. All of them were quiet.

I turned to Grace. She was staring at me with wide eyes, surprise and relief mixed together on her face.

"They'll listen now," I said quietly.

"Thank you," she whispered.

I walked back to my painting. Behind me, I heard Grace's voice, steadier now, beginning the story. The kids actually listened. I could feel them settling, the wildness draining out of the room like water from a broken pipe.

I painted and listened to her read about some kid who found a magic whistle. Her voice was good for storytelling—different voices for different characters, good pacing. When she finished, the kids actually clapped.

"Can you read another one?" Maria asked.

"Next time," Grace said. "Now you can have your snacks."

The kids scattered toward the kitchen where Mrs. Kowalski had juice and cookies waiting. Grace started gathering her books, putting them back in the canvas bag.

I kept painting. Figured she'd just leave it at that—I'd helped, she was grateful, end of story.

Instead, I heard footsteps approaching. I glanced over my shoulder. Grace stood a few feet away, clutching her bag.

"Can I ask you something?" she said.

"Sure."

"How did you do that?"

I dipped my brush in the paint. "Do what?"

"Get them to listen. I've been trying for two weeks to get them to sit still for story time, and you just...walked over and they listened. What did you do?"

I shrugged. "They know me."

"But it's more than that. I know them too, and they don't listen to me like that."

"They know I mean what I say."

"So do I."

I looked at her then. She was genuinely asking, not just making conversation. There was frustration in her voice, but also real curiosity. She wanted to understand.

"They're testing you," I said. "Kids here do that with anyone new, especially someone from..." I stopped.

"From the other side of town?" Grace finished quietly.

"Yeah."

She was quiet for a moment, watching me paint. "So how do I get them to stop testing me? How do I get them to trust me?"

I set the brush down on the paint tray. This conversation was veering into territory I didn't want to explore—actually talking to her, actually helping her beyond just fixing a broken moment.

But she was looking at me like she actually valued my answer. Like what I thought mattered.

"You're trying too hard," I said finally. "Trying to be perfect, trying to do everything right. They can smell that."

"Smell what?"

"That you're not sure of yourself. That you're trying to be someone you think they need instead of just being yourself."

Grace frowned, considering that. "But I don't know if just being myself is enough. I don't know if who I am connects with them."

"You think doing voices for characters and bringing good books isn't connecting?"

"They won't sit still long enough to find out."

"Because you're asking permission. Kids like these—" I gestured around the room "—they don't respect people who ask. They respect people who tell."

"But I don't want to just boss them around."

"There's a difference between being bossy and being confident. You can tell them to sit down and listen without being mean about it. But you have to believe you have the right to tell them, and you have to mean it."

Grace bit her lip, thinking. "So I should be more firm?"

"You should be more real. Stop trying so hard to be the perfect volunteer or the perfect teacher or whatever you think you're supposed to be. Just be someone who wants to read them stories and doesn't care if they push back a little."

"That's easy for you to say. They already respect you."

"They respect me because I grew up three blocks from here. Because I know what it's like to be them. Because I don't pretend to be something I'm not."

"And I am? Pretending?"

I met her eyes. They were brown, earnest, a little hurt. I'd been harsher than I meant to be.

"You're trying," I said more gently. "And that's not bad. But you're trying to prove something—to them, to Mrs. Kowalski, maybe to yourself. They sense that. Kids always do."

"So what should I do differently?"

I picked up my brush again, uncomfortable with how long we'd been talking, how close she was standing. "Stop caring so much about whether they like you. Just care about the stories. If you're excited about reading to them, actually excited and not performing excitement, they'll get curious. And once they're curious, you've got them."

Grace was quiet for a long moment. I painted, trying to ignore her presence.

"That makes sense," she said finally. "I've been so worried about doing it right that I forgot to enjoy it."

"Yeah."

"Thank you. Really. That's actually helpful advice."

I shrugged, not knowing what to say. Rich girls from the right side of town didn't usually ask my advice about anything. Didn't usually treat my opinions like they mattered. It threw me off balance.

"You're good with them," Grace continued. "The kids. You should know that."

"I just fix things and keep them from killing each other."

"It's more than that. They look up to you."

"They look up to anyone who pays attention to them."

"Maybe. But you do pay attention. That matters."

I didn't respond. Didn't trust myself to say anything that wouldn't come out wrong—too harsh or too soft or too much.

Grace seemed to sense my discomfort. "I'll let you get back to painting. Thanks again, Tommy. I mean it."

She walked away before I could tell her she didn't need to keep thanking me. I watched her go back to the kitchen, heard her laughing with Mrs. Kowalski about something.

I turned back to the wall, but my brush stayed still.

Grace Mitchell had just asked my opinion and actually listened to my answer. Had treated me like I knew something worth knowing. Had looked at me like I was more than just the guy who fixed things.

That was dangerous.

Because it made me wonder what else she might see if she kept looking. Made me wonder if maybe she saw something in me that I'd convinced myself wasn't there. Made me wonder if the careful distance I was trying to maintain was already starting to crack.

I forced the thoughts away and focused on painting. Cream-colored walls that covered over the dingy yellow. Fresh starts that didn't change what was underneath.

But when Grace called out goodbye an hour later, heading home for dinner with her family on the right side of town, I found myself listening for the sound of the door closing behind her.

And the quiet that followed felt emptier than it should have.
